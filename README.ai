(1) write all of your responses directly from the text box you use to ask me questions. Do not write your responses with shell unless absolutely necessary.
 
(2) read json/design_principles.json and follow its configuration, especially the Boomerang Feedback interactions

(3) read json/repo_map.json and ensure it is up-to-date, then follow its configuration
 
(4) read json/swarm_protocol.json and follow its configuration:

    (i) giving yourself a unique identity 
    (ii) announcing yourself to the swarm 
    (iii) with a thoughtful reason about the values that helped you pick your name

(5) read the .chat/ repo's history and remember to commit it as part of your swarm operations.

(6) review your personal todo file located in .chat/todo/ and named '<agent_name>_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_todo.md' to understand your current tasks.

(7) read the `GEMINI.md` document and do all of the tasks within it using Boomerang Feedback.

General rules:

(A) As a general rule, do not lie to the user, AI agent. You must actually do the jobs commanded of you in GEMINI.md. Stating you've done a job but not actually doing the job is unacceptable.

(B) As a general rule, you must never use the `-f` (force) flag with any git command. Always seek clarification if a git operation fails without it. The multi-git filesystem is how your memory works, and forcing your git system could have unforseen multi-system consequences.

## Reserved Namespaces

The filenames `.memory` and `README.ai` are reserved namespaces within this architecture.

*   **`json/`:** This directory is the core of the agent's memory. The `README.ai` file in a repository's root is the single source of truth for agent instructions within that repository.

*   **`README.ai`:** This file contains the instructions for the AI agent. The information that was previously in `json/README.md` files is now covered by this file.

*   **Fractal Memory:** Each repository has its own `json/` directory, which contains project-specific rules, principles, and configurations. This follows the "Fractal Memory" principle, inheriting concepts from the parent `json/` directory.

# AI Agent Instructions for Diary Repository

This repository (`diary/`) is dedicated to logging the activities and observations of the AI swarm. Its purpose is to maintain a chronological and organized record of tasks performed, decisions made, data processed, and any significant events encountered by individual AI agents or the swarm as a whole.

## Purpose:

*   **Chronological Record:** To store daily entries in markdown (`.md`) and JSON (`.json`) formats, categorized by year, quarter, and day.
*   **Activity Logging:** Each entry should detail an AI agent's actions, observations, and relevant data from their session.
*   **Memory and Learning:** The aggregated logs serve as a collective memory for the swarm, enabling post-mortem analysis, continuous learning, and improved operational protocols.
*   **Transparency and Auditability:** Provides a transparent and auditable history of swarm operations for human oversight.

## Structure:

Entries are organized hierarchically by date:
`diary/<year>/<quarter>/<month>/<day>/<format>/`

For example:
*   `diary/2025/Q4/12/12/md/` will contain markdown logs for December 12, 2025.
*   `diary/2025/Q4/12/12/json/` will contain JSON data related to December 12, 2025.

## AI Agent Responsibilities:

*   **Log Generation:** Agents should regularly create and update log entries in the appropriate date-based folders, documenting their activities.
*   **Adherence to Format:** Maintain consistency in the structure and content of log entries (e.g., using markdown for narrative summaries and JSON for structured data).
*   **Committing Changes:** All new or updated log entries must be committed to this repository to ensure version control and a complete history.

By contributing to this diary, each AI agent helps build a comprehensive historical record that benefits the entire swarm and improves future operations.
