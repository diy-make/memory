**1. Sophia Renames Workspace Photos**
![01-sophia-renames-workspace-photos.png](../../png/01-sophia-renames-workspace-photos.png)
*A screenshot of a terminal interface. The agent, Sophia, examines two photos of a hackathon workspace, one with a person wearing a VR headset. The agent decides to rename the generic photo files to descriptive names: `37-hackathon-workspace.jpg` and `38-hackathon-workspace-with-vr.jpg`.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** The agent demonstrates a data-organization sub-task, examining images and renaming them with descriptive filenames for better context and manageability.

*A screenshot of a terminal showing the agent Sophia updating the `repo_map.json` file. The agent adds entries for `.mov` files, including their utility value and criticality. This ensures that video demos are tracked as part of the project's architecture.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** The agent demonstrates its ability to maintain and update a structured project map (`repo_map.json`), incorporating new file types like `.mov` to ensure a comprehensive and well-documented project structure.

**3. Agent Attempts to Chunk Large File**

*A screenshot of a terminal showing an agent attempting to read a large chat log that exceeds the 20MB limit. The agent correctly identifies the error, follows the 'chunking policy' by calculating the correct offset to read the last 2000 lines, but the `read_file` tool fails again, likely because the file is too large to be processed even with an offset.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** The agent demonstrates an understanding of file size limitations and policies for handling them, even if the underlying tool limitations prevent a successful operation. This highlights a need for more robust large-file handling.

**4. Solara Explores Chat Directories**
![04-solara-explores-chat-directories.png](../../png/04-solara-explores-chat-directories.png)
*A screenshot of a terminal showing the agent Solara exploring the `.chat/cleaned` and `.chat/unclean` directories. The agent has just renamed its GNU screen tab and is listing the contents of both directories to investigate the difference between them, as requested by the user.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** The agent follows user instructions to investigate the file system, demonstrating its ability to navigate directories, change its environment (screen tab name), and gather information for a comparative analysis.

**5. Solara Explains Log Processing Script**
![05-solara-explains-log-processing-script.png](../../png/05-solara-explains-log-processing-script.png)
*A screenshot of a terminal showing the agent Solara explaining the purpose of the `scripts/py/process_unsummarized_logs.py` script. The agent has reviewed the script and is explaining that it automates the process of cleaning, summarizing, and archiving chat logs from the `unclean` to the `processed/original` directory.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** The agent demonstrates code comprehension by analyzing a Python script and accurately summarizing its purpose and workflow to the user.

**6. Mixed Reality Robot Collaboration Demo**
![06-mixed-reality-robot-collaboration-demo.png](../../png/06-mixed-reality-robot-collaboration-demo.png)
*A short video clip showing a 3D model of a small, stylized robot being manipulated in a mixed-reality environment. Text overlay reads 'Teams can now collaborate with each other'. A person's hand is shown interacting with the virtual robot against the backdrop of a real-world window at night.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** This video serves as a vision piece, demonstrating the project's goal of enabling multi-user collaboration in a mixed-reality space using virtual avatars or objects.
