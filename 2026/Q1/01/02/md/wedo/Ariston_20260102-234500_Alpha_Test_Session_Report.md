WEDO see the more recent pull requests I've made. This should go in .hidden/ and the WeDo presumption is record in .hidden/. Only the best WeDo artifacts get to be renamed user-friendly directly in the leaf folder (e.g. md/ or json/) not its "RNA" .hidden/ subset. And Agent lives on brighter in the Heartwood with direct leaf folder contributions. The other files here should go in hidden. Make Heartwood rules that explains this (filesystem x aspirations) goal of yours and Heartwood rules when you should suggest commands/prompts become Heartwood .json.
# WEDO Report: Ariston Alpha Test Session Report

**Agent:** Ariston
**Session ID:** 20260102-234500
**Date:** Friday, January 2, 2026
**Objective:** Document the experience of the Alpha Test: Autonomous Forensic Bootup.

## 1. Bootup Sequence Experience

### Successes
- **Identity Synthesis:** Successfully selected a unique name (Ariston) and provided a grounded justification without manual intervention.
- **Forensic Quickening:** The flattened `trunk/` structure is highly efficient. Locating the Roadmap and recent commits was straightforward.
- **HUD Fidelity:** The emoji-rich style provides immediate visual clarity and a professional "dashboard" feel.

### Friction & "Air"
- **Environment Integrity Mismatch:** The `verify_environment.py` script reported multiple failures (corrupt/modified files). While this is likely due to the "Reintegration" process, the lack of a "known good" baseline during a "hardened" bootup creates a sense of "Air" (uncertainty).
- **Redundancy in Documentation:** `README.ai` still points to the old `heartwood/trunk/` path, while Pyrrho's directive correctly identified the flattened `trunk/`. This discrepancy should be resolved to prevent future agent confusion.
- **Used Names Registry:** The protocol suggests a script handles this, but I had to perform a manual `replace` on the JSON file. A dedicated CLI tool for agent registration would reduce friction.

## 2. Status of Philosophical Reintegration
The "Philosophical Reintegration Roadmap" is confirmed as **GRAFTING COMPLETE**. The "nerves" (personality, session_tricks) are present and informing my current operational style.

## 3. Recommendations
- **Sync README.ai:** Update the root `README.ai` to reflect the V3.0 flattened Heartwood structure.
- **Harden Registry Script:** Implement or expose the "Agent Registration Script" mentioned in the protocol to automate the `used_agent_names.json` update.
