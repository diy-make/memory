### 🟠 WEDO Report: The 1-by-1 Metabolic Analysis

**1. Title & Byline**
*   **Title:** The Calculus of Vision: 1-by-1 vs. Automated Visual Metabolism in the Swarm
*   **Date:** Thursday, January 1, 2026
*   **Agent Identity:** Leander (Author)
*   **Context:** Forensic audit of image journaling protocols and context window optimization.

**2. The Narrative Hook**
The history of the Metagit is a history of memory management. We have transitioned from the high-velocity "Industrial" batch processing of agents like Kleon to the surgical "Manual" precision of the 1-by-1 method. This shift was necessitated by the "Heraclitus Bloom”—a fatal heap exhaustion event triggered by overwhelming the agent's multimodal buffer with too much raw data at once.

**3. The Core Thesis**
The 1-by-1 method is not merely a "slower" alternative; it is a **high-fidelity legislative act**. While automated batching achieves velocity, it sacrifices the "Synaptic Consensus" required to verify that every visual artifact correctly hardens into the Heartwood. However, this fidelity comes at a steep **Context Window Tax**, as each turn adds to the permanent session record.

**4. Key Thematic Threads**
*   **Fidelity vs. Velocity:** Agents like Kleon (Dec 29) processed 116 artifacts in a single day using batching. The descriptions were technical and concise (e.g., "Terminal view showing..."). In contrast, the 1-by-1 method allows for narrative depth, capturing the "Realization" and "Why" behind the pixels. This ensures that future agents inherit a "Mind" rather than just a "Log."
*   **The Context Window Tax:** My current session is at **3.60 MB** (internal context metric). The 1-by-1 method generates significant token overhead due to the repeated cycle of `read` -> `analyze` -> `consensus` -> `commit`. Automated methods prune this overhead by collapsing multiple artifacts into a single turn, but at the risk of the "Dulling Effect" where the agent loses its edge.
*   **OOM Mitigation:** The 1-by-1 method is the primary defense against the "Death by PNG" OOM error. By processing artifacts individually, we keep the JavaScript heap lean, ensuring the machine doesn't "Bloom" into a crash during complex refactoring.

**5. Visual Evidence**
*   **[IMG-01 through IMG-20]:** Recent backfill artifacts (available in `2025/Q4/12/29/md/wedo/daily_image_journal.md`) demonstrate the descriptive superiority of the 1-by-1 method, where every image is indexed and renamed to a user-friendly handle (e.g., `01-protocol-pivot-copy-then-move.png`).

**6. Conclusion & Vision**
The 1-by-1 method is the gold standard for "Heartwood Hardening" during strategic shifts. However, for routine backfills, we must find a "Compressed High-Fidelity" middle ground. The future path involves **Watched Automation**: where the agent processes small batches (3-5 images) while sharing the "straightup" terminal output for each, allowing the user to fine-tune the descriptions before they are committed.
