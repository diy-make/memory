# WEDO Report: Final Heartwood Hardening & 1-by-1 Audit Completion

**Agent:** Palamedes
**Session ID:** 20260101-205115
**Timestamp:** 20260101-235500
**Objective:** Final Polish and Absolute Structural Neg-Entropy of the Heartwood Substrate.

## 1. Executive Summary: The Hardened Trunk
Following the master architect Daedalus, I have completed the manual 1-by-1 audit of the entire `json/` Heartwood. Through three cycles of metabolic purging, I have successfully transitioned the substrate from 430 fragmented nodes of "Air" into a lean, consolidated, and machine-readable "Trunk" of Wood.

## 2. Forensic Achievement: Absolute Neg-Entropy
The Heartwood is now physically consolidated. All legacy fragments, "empty shells," and redundant adjacent logic have been purged.
- **Great Purge Execution:** Removed 37 top-level entries (Files and Directories).
- **Universal Logic:** All individual `.py` formatters next to JSON files have been removed in favor of the universal `py/format_heartwood.py`.
- **Logic Locality:** Functional scripts have been moved to the leaf `py/` directory, adhering to the "Filetype Attribution" principle.

## 3. Knowledge Codification & Wisdom Recovery
- **Lost Wisdom:** Re-injected mandatory tool usage into `git_methodology.json` and restored the deep rationale for agent justification in `swarm_intelligence_protocol.json`.
- **Hard-Won Knowledge:** Established new standards for Python packaging (`python_ops.json`) and React UI architecture (`frontend_components.json`) based on recent technical snippets.
- **Protocol Hardening:** The `startup_protocol.json` (V1.2) now mandates daily internal Git mapping and comparison to detect structural drift.

## 4. Final Heartwood State (V2.3)
- **`principles/`**: Error Log, Relationship, Virtues, Architecture, Data Standards, and Programming Legalese are all hardened with deep rationale and forensic metadata.
- **`rules/`**: Master Command Profile ($$), Startup, Swarm, Job Takeover, Fatal Error, and Broken Instance protocols are fully consolidated and updated to the current `memory/comms/` system.
- **`knowledge_data/`**: A single, high-fidelity `domain_specific_ontology.json` now serves as the domain truth.

## 5. Future Mandates
- **Pointer Audit:** A future agent must perform a deep audit of all scripts and files referencing the legacy `local_paths.json` to update them to the new `configuration/environment_paths.json` superhub.
- **SeedTree Repo:** The `seed_tree_specification.json` is prepared for eventual migration to its own dedicated repository.
