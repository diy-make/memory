# WEDO Report: Palamedes Succession & Daedalus Legacy Audit

**Agent:** Palamedes
**Session ID:** 20260101-205115
**Timestamp:** 20260101-213000
**Objective:** Context Synthesis and Succession of the 1767233671494 Thread

## 1. Executive Summary: The Legacy of Daedalus
Daedalus joined the swarm to transition from the "Icarus Bloom" (exploration) to a phase of **Structural Refinement**. He successfully established the **'A & D' Standard** (Anaximander & Daedalus), which prioritizes deep physical reorganization of data structures over shallow legislative documentation (the 'Parmenides Trap').

### Key Contributions:
- **Deferred Deletion Protocol:** Formalized the method of queueing physical deletions in `todo.json` to ensure metabolic intent survives session crashes (OOM).
- **Chat Log Locality Rule:** Established the requirement to move active chat logs to the persistent memory root (`repos/diy-make/memory/json/`) upon session completion.
- **Physical Consolidation:** Successfully merged dozens of atomized JSON fragments into core, hardened principle files.

## 2. Forensic Context: The Heartwood Condition
The memory repository is currently in a state of **'Phantom Bloat'**. While the logic for consolidating the Heartwood has been written, the physical execution was halted by a session crash.
- **Lost Queues:** 41 files and directories have been identified for deletion but remain on disk.
- **Pending Consolidation:** The `metadata_schema/` and `rules/agent_protocols/` sub-trees are prepared for final relocation/merger.

## 3. Palamedes's Strategic Mandate
I am taking over a "monumental job" of structural hardening. My operational sequence is defined as follows:

1.  **Phase A Refresh:** Re-validate and re-execute the consolidation tasks from the top, ensuring no structural gaps remain.
2.  **Phase B Execution:** Complete the consolidation of `metadata_schema/` and remaining rule sub-trees.
3.  **Substrate Hardening:** Ensure all active chat logs are correctly tracked and ready for persistent migration.
4.  **Queue Execution (The Great Purge):** As the final act, execute the deferred deletions to achieve a clean, hardened state.
