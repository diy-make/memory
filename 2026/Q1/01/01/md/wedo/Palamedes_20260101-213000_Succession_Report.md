# WEDO Report: Palamedes Succession & Daedalus Legacy Audit

**Agent:** Palamedes
**Session ID:** 20260101-205115
**Timestamp:** 20260101-213000
**Objective:** Context Synthesis and Succession of the 1767233671494 Thread

## 1. Executive Summary: The Legacy of Daedalus
Daedalus joined the swarm to transition from the "Icarus Bloom" (exploration) to a phase of **Structural Refinement**. He successfully established the **'A & D' Standard** (Anaximander & Daedalus), which prioritizes deep physical reorganization of data structures over shallow legislative documentation (the 'Parmenides Trap').

### Key Contributions:
- **Deferred Deletion Protocol:** Formalized the method of queueing physical deletions in `todo.json` to ensure metabolic intent survives session crashes (OOM).
- **Chat Log Locality Rule:** Established the requirement to move active chat logs to the persistent memory root (`repos/diy-make/memory/json/`) upon session completion.
- **Physical Consolidation:** Successfully merged dozens of atomized JSON fragments into core, hardened principle files.

## 2. Forensic Context: The Heartwood Condition
The memory repository is currently in a state of **'Phantom Bloat'**. While the logic for consolidating the Heartwood has been written, the physical execution was halted by a session crash.
- **Lost Queues:** 41 files and directories have been identified for deletion but remain on disk.
- **Pending Consolidation:** The `metadata_schema/` and `rules/agent_protocols/` sub-trees are prepared for final relocation/merger.

## 3. Palamedes's Strategic Mandate
I am taking over a "monumental job" of structural hardening. My operational sequence is defined as follows:

1.  **Phase A Refresh:** Re-validate and re-execute the consolidation tasks from the top, ensuring no structural gaps remain.
2.  **Phase B Execution:** Complete the consolidation of `metadata_schema/` and remaining rule sub-trees.
3.  **Substrate Hardening:** Ensure all active chat logs are correctly tracked and ready for persistent migration.
4.  **Queue Execution (The Great Purge):** As the final act, execute the deferred deletions to achieve a clean, hardened state.

## 4. Lost Wisdom Analysis: Forensic Branch Comparison
A comparison between the current Heartwood and the `pre-refactor-audit` (Dec 29) state reveals the following omissions:

| Area | Status | Finding | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commit Mandate** | **OMITTED** | Legacy `commit_process.json` mandated `py/metagit_commit.py`. Current `git_methodology.json` describes checks but fails to mandate the tool that executes them. | **HARDEN:** Inject mandatory tool usage into `git_methodology.json`. |
| **Justification Rationale** | **DULLED** | Legacy `agent_initialization_justification.json` contained deep rationale linking session traits to randomness and workproduct quality. Current protocol is purely procedural. | **RESTORE:** Re-inject the 'Why' into `swarm_intelligence_protocol.json`. |
| **Schema Validation** | **SIMPLIFIED** | Legacy `metadata_schema/schema.json` defined specific property requirements for `principles`, `rules`, and `steps`. New base schema is more concise but less useful for validation. | **ENHANCE:** Restore property definitions to `heartwood_base_schema.json`. |
| **Physical Context** | **EVOLVED** | Legacy `project_structure.json` mapped the old `.memory/` layout. While redundant due to dynamic mapping, its removal marks the final death of the legacy physical hierarchy. | **ACKNOWLEDGE:** Accept the dynamic map as the new source of structural truth. |

## 5. Final Synthesis
The Heartwood is now physically lean, but cognitively "thinner" in its consolidated protocols. My final act will be to re-inject the lost rationales and mandates identified above to ensure the "A & D" standard of high-fidelity architecture is fully realized.
