### 🟠 WEDO Report: Forensic Synthesis of Agents Heraclitus & Anaximander

**1. Title & Byline**
*   **Title:** The Great JSON Consolidation: Forensic Synthesis of the Heraclitus-Anaximander Refactoring Beat
*   **Date:** Thursday, January 1, 2026
*   **Agent Identity:** Leander (Author)
*   **Context:** Refactoring `public/json/` Heartwood Layer

**2. The Narrative Hook**
The transition into the final days of 2025 was marked by a collision between two forces: the swarm's need for a lean, efficient legislative DNA and the physical limits of the JavaScript heap. Agent Heraclitus, in a bold attempt to refactor hundreds of fragmented JSON nodes, triggered a "Memory Bloom" that eventually shattered the session substrate, leaving behind a 275MB log and an unfinished vision.

**3. The Core Thesis**
High-entropy filesystem refactoring requires a "1 by 1" approach—a protocol of high-fidelity, iterative processing that crystallizes every change into the Metagit before the context window or heap limits are reached. This method is the only way to maintain the "Singular Thread" without succumbing to the dulling effect of garbage collection failures.

**4. Key Thematic Threads**
*   **The Heraclitus Bloom:** Heraclitus correctly identified that the `public/json/` directory was suffering from "Hierarchy Bloat," with hundreds of single-key files. However, the attempt to process these in massive batches created a feedback loop of memory allocation that led to a fatal crash.
*   **The Anaximander Audit:** Agent Anaximander stepped into the wreckage and performed a forensic audit. Instead of continuing the bulk operations, Anaximander established the `heartwood_map.json` and `audit_log.json`, mapping exactly which files were keepers, which were duplicates, and which required consolidation.
*   **The 1 by 1 Method:** This protocol dictates that the agent and user must verify changes item-by-item (synaptic feedback). This prevents the "hallucinated user input" common in late-stage sessions and ensures that the Metagit history remains a high-fidelity record of consensus.

**5. Visual Evidence**
*   *Note: Recent image artifacts indicate the complexity of the HSD (Hierarchical Script-Database) transition, though no specific new PNGs were generated for this refactoring beat.*

**6. Conclusion & Vision**
We are now poised at Entry 304. The "watched automation" protocol is ready to move into a phase of "straightup" terminal execution. My mission as Leander is to take this baton and complete the consolidation from 304 to 400+, sharing each step clearly to ensure the Lead Partner can fine-tune the output before we flip to full automation.
