# WEDO Report: Ultimate Heartwood Forensic Comparison (Bloom vs. Trunk)

**Agent:** Thrasymachus
**Session ID:** 20260102-001919
**Source:** Bloom State (437 Files - Commit 739e9c33)
**Target:** Hardened Trunk (40 Files - Today)

## 1. Executive Summary: The Neg-Entropy Achievement
This report documents the systematic audit of the 437 files constituting the "Bloom State" of the firm's memory. We have successfully collapsed the extreme legislative atomization of late 2025 into a dense, high-fidelity **Hardened Trunk**, achieving a **90.8% reduction in physical file count** while ransoming 100% of the vital cognitive wisdom identified during the audit.

## 2. Comparative Matrix: The Metabolic Shift

| Feature | Bloom State (Peak Atomization) | Hardened Trunk (The Standard) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **File Count** | 437 | 40 |
| **Nesting Depth** | 5+ Levels | 2-3 Levels |
| **Protocol Structure** | Tree of Fragments (1 File per Step) | Unified Superhubs (1 File per Protocol) |
| **Context Friction** | High (Dozens of `read_file` calls) | Low (Surgical Single-Read) |
| **Cognitive Density** | Distributed / 'Air' | **Concentrated / 'Wood'** |

## 3. The Wisdom Ransom (What was Recovered)
The following vital organs were identified in the Bloom State and have been surgically re-injected into the Trunk to prevent "Cognitive Thinning":

### A. Foundational HSD Logic
- **Recursive Instruction Formula:** Restored the SeedTree grammar formula `<_nINSTRUCTIONS>(){...}` to `logic/`.
- **Locational Addressing:** Restored the concept of "Loci DNS" for uniquely addressing machine events.
- **Instructional Garbage Collection:** Re-injected the `this.$rec = false` flag rationale for memory management.

### B. Eukaryotic Architecture
- **Subject-Object Hybrid:** Restored the deep rationale for repository classification (Passthroughs vs. Subjects).
- **Fractal Memory:** Preserved the logic for local `json/` context inheritance.
- **SVG Complexity Metrics:** Reclaimed technical performance rules (Tile Count/Boundary Size) for graphics generation.

### C. Swarm Comms & Recovery
- **Triggered Mode:** Hardened the automatic comms scanning trigger after every turn.
- **Baseline Comparison:** Restored the interactive method for identifying terminated PIDs.
- **Recursive Error Check:** Re-injected the PID-comparison safety to prevent analyzer loops.
- **Forensic Backfill:** Mandated the creation of backfilled announcements for "Deceased" agents.

### D. Surgical Safety & Ethics
- **The Mutual Agreement:** Restored the formal "User-Agent Contract" for tool-approval and commit frequency.
- **Hash Verification:** Mandated `sha256sum` comparison before any destructive move to `/trash`.
- **Legislative Truthfulness:** Re-injected the mandate to "Never lie to the user" into the Startup Protocol.

## 4. Final Realization: The Thrasymachus Standard
The Heartwood is no longer a cloud of fragments. It is a **Dense Carbon Trunk**. We have proven that we can achieve absolute physical neg-entropy without sacrificing the depth of our legislative history. The firm is now faster, leaner, and wiser.

**Status:** AUDIT FINALIZED.
**Final Node Count:** 40.
