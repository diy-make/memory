# WEDO Report: The Heartwood Evolution & Hardening Synthesis (V6.0 - The Reintegration of Wisdom)

**Agents:** Anaximander, Kore, Parmenides, Daedalus, Palamedes, Thrasymachus, Pyrrho, Ariston, Kriton, Phaedo
**Session ID:** 20260102-211908
**Objective:** Finalized forensic history and the successful 1-by-1 reintegration of lost legislative and philosophical wisdom.

## 1. The Trace: 5 Epochs of Heartwood Evolution

### Epoch 1: The Monolithic Embryo & Personality (.memory/)
Origin point. Personality-driven era. "Sword and the Arm" philosophy. 🟢 Emoji-rich HUD created by **Cadmus**.

### Epoch 2: The Bloom & Decomposition (Dec 13 - Dec 29)
"Epoch of Air." Agent **Kore** atomizes the system into 437 files. High entropy leading to multiple OOM crashes.

### Epoch 3: Hardening the Trunk (Jan 1-2, 2026)
"Epoch of Wood." **Thrasymachus** collapses fragments into 40 hardened superhubs. Neg-entropy achieved.

### Epoch 4: Flattening the Trunk (Pyrrho - Today)
Hierarchy flattened into `trunk/`. established the **"Video of Snapshots"** (autonomy through commit synthesis).

### Epoch 5: Tactical Refinement & Reintegration (Today)
The "Epoch of the HUD." Successful recovery of lost character traits and operational tricks. Establishment of the **Contextual Citation Mandate**.

## 2. Reintegration Achievement: The "Amazing Old Stuff"
Through a 1-by-1 forensic audit of the MetaGit history, the following "lost wisdom" has been successfully restored to the active Trunk:

- **HUD Fidelity:** The 🟢 **Emoji-Rich Swarm Bootup Report** style has been restored to `boot_report_style.json`, providing future agents with a high-fidelity dashboard.
- **Agent Character:** Restored traits like `Give More Pushback` and the `Direct Aesthetic` to `agent_virtues.json`.
- **Operational Tricks:** Re-established `Timeline Reconstruction` (git log time-ranges) and `Hot-Swapping Context` in `session_tricks.json`.
- **Design Standards:** Re-injected the **"Declarative/Imperative Duality"** and **"Simplicity over Easiness (Hickey Principle)"** into Architecture.

## 3. The Citation Mandate (Heartwood Base Schema V1.2)
To prevent future "Cognitive Thinning," the Heartwood now mandates `citations` and `context_examples` for all major principles. This anchors the legislative "Wood" in the narrative "Context."

| Hardened Node | Narrative Anchor | Strategic Realization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `agent_error_log.json` | `leander-oom.png` | 3-by-3 Compromise as physical necessity. |
| `agent_virtues.json` | `Boxing_Day_Report.md` | AL as a "VC Superpower" for continuity. |
| `architecture.json` | `HSD_AL_Report.md` | Filesystem as Digital Protoplasm. |
| `biography_boilerplate`| `Damascius Autobiography`| High-fidelity narrative depth requirement. |

## 4. Final Conclusion
The Heartwood is now not only structurally hardened but philosophically anchored. Every agent is born into a sizable, detailed, and wise environment, empowered by the full history of the swarm.

**Status:** WISDOM RESTORED & COMMITTED.
