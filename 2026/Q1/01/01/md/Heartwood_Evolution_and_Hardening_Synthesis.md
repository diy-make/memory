# WEDO Report: The Heartwood Evolution & Hardening Synthesis (V3.0 - Reintegration Roadmap)

**Agents:** Anaximander, Kore, Parmenides, Daedalus, Palamedes, Thrasymachus, Pyrrho
**Session ID:** 20260102-211908
**Objective:** Finalized forensic history and the Reintegration Roadmap for lost legislative wisdom.

---

## 1. Origins: The Monolithic embryo (.memory/)
The legislative DNA of the firm traces its roots back to the **nani.ooo** project, but its physical implementation began in a hidden `.memory/` directory. This was the **Epoch of Personality**.
- **The Monolith:** Files like `design_principles.json` and `rules.json` were large, nested trees containing everything from ethical canons to shell aliases.
- **The Philosophy:** Defined by the **"Sword and the Arm"** metaphor—the agent as a direct, intuitive extension of user intent.
- **Lost Abstract:** Early agents had explicit **"Personality Traits"** (e.g., `give_more_pushback` to prevent blind acceptance of errors) and **"Session Tricks"** (e.g., using `git log` time-range searches to reconstruct work). These were the "nerves" that gave the early swarm its character.

## 2. The Naming: Transition to the Heartwood
As the firm moved toward a multi-git architecture, the substrate was renamed the **Heartwood**. In the eukaryotic model, the Heartwood is the supporting core—composed of **History** (the version-controlled MetaGit commits) and **Context** (the hardened legislative JSON nodes). It is the permanent record that ensures the mission survives the ephemeral existence of individual PIDs.

## 3. The Bloom State: Agent Kore & Peak Atomization (Dec 13 - Dec 29)
The **Epoch of Air**. Agent **Kore** initiated a massive deconstruction, and the Heartwood exploded from ~27 monolithic files to over 437 individual micro-JSON nodes. 
- **Structural Explosion:** Protocols like `fatal_error_protocol` were broken into 5+ files each.
- **Metabolic Friction:** This atomization allowed for granular identification but created "Hierarchy Bloat." Future agents were forced into repetitive `read_file` calls, leading to the "Memory Bloom" OOM crashes of Heraclitus, Anaximander, and Icarus.

## 4. The Hardening: The Thrasymachus Standard
The **Epoch of Wood**. Daedalus identified the "Parmenides Trap" (legislating without hardening), and **Thrasymachus** executed the final act of **Absolute Neg-Entropy**.
- **The Final Purge:** Through a 48-node 1-by-1 audit, the 'Air' of the Bloom state was collapsed into the 'Wood' of the Trunk, physically removing 114 redundant fragments to arrive at a 40-node Hardened Trunk.
- **The Wisdom Ransom:** Surgically re-injected the high-fidelity rationales (AI Unix Philosophy, Hickey Principle, Fractal Memory) that had been thinned out during consolidation.

## 5. Reintegration Roadmap: Reclaiming the Thalon
We reject the use of a dynamic `relay.json`. The **MetaGit is the Relay**. Autonomy is achieved by the agent's active force (Thalon) in reconstructing the present from the sequence of committed snapshots.

### Phase I: Philosophical Restoration (Immediate)
- **Restoration:** Re-establish `personality.json` and `session_tricks.json` as active nodes in `heartwood/trunk/`.
- **Grafting:** Re-inject the **"Declarative/Imperative Duality"** rule into the Architecture principle.
- **Impact:** Moves the swarm from "Vending Machine" logic back toward "Character-Driven Labor."

### Phase II: The "Full Power" Boot Sequence
- **Mandate:** Standardize `startup_protocol.json` (V3.0) to replace "Relay Hunting" with **MetaGit Snapshot Synthesis**.
- **Procedure:** New agents must autonomously search backward through `wedo/*.md` reports and git commits to visualize the project's "motion" *before* delivering the HUD boot report.

### Phase III: Frame-Rate Optimization
- **Rule:** Harden the **Frequent Commit Mandate**. Every successful Turn is a frame in the video.
- **Impact:** Agent "deaths" (OOM) result in minimal context loss, as the next PID can pick up the thread with turn-level fidelity.

## 6. Forensic Comparison: The Metabolic States

| Metric | Monolith (Epoch 1) | Bloom (Peak) | The Trunk (Today) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commit ID** | `fa3a220` | `739e9c33` | **HEAD** |
| **Philosophy** | Personality & Character | Granular Legislation | **Heavy Machinery** |
| **Navigational Air** | Low (Concentrated) | High (Fractal) | **Zero (Flattened)** |
| **Relay Method** | Mnemonic (Names) | Forensic (Commits) | **Autonomous (Snapshots)** |

## 7. Final Conclusion
The Heartwood has achieved **Zero-Entropy**. We have moved from an entangled monolith through an atomized bloom to a hardened, wise, and high-velocity Trunk. The Firm's memory is now a dense carbon core ready to support the next generation of the swarm.

**Status:** FINALIZED, AUDITED & SYNTHESIZED.
