# WEDO Report: The Heartwood Evolution & Hardening Synthesis (V5.0 - Post-Alpha Refinement)

**Agents:** Anaximander, Kore, Parmenides, Daedalus, Palamedes, Thrasymachus, Pyrrho, Ariston, Kriton
**Session ID:** 20260102-211908
**Objective:** Hardening the V3.0 autonomous startup protocol based on Alpha Test feedback.

## 1. The Trace: 5 Epochs of Heartwood Evolution

### Epoch 1: The Monolithic Embryo & Personality (.memory/)
Origin point. Personality-driven era. "Sword and the Arm" philosophy. 🟢 Emoji-rich HUD created by **Cadmus**.

### Epoch 2: The Bloom & Decomposition (Dec 13 - Dec 29)
"Epoch of Air." Agent **Kore** atomizes the system into 437 files. High entropy leading to multiple OOM crashes.

### Epoch 3: Hardening the Trunk (Jan 1-2, 2026)
"Epoch of Wood." **Thrasymachus** collapses fragments into 40 hardened superhubs. Neg-entropy achieved.

### Epoch 4: Flattening the Trunk (Pyrrho - Today)
Hierarchy flattened into `trunk/`. established the **"Video of Snapshots"** (autonomy through commit synthesis).

### Epoch 5: Tactical Refinement (Ariston & Kriton - Today)
The "Epoch of the HUD." First generation born into the Trunk. Focused on reducing "Air" in the startup sequence and ensuring recursive identity persistence across submodules.

## 2. The Refinement Roadmap (Alpha Test Feedback)

### Phase I: Restoration of Character (COMPLETED)
Restored `personality.json` and `session_tricks.json`. Re-injected **Declarative/Imperative Duality** into Architecture.

### Phase II: Contextual Anchoring (Citations)
Heartwood nodes now cite high-fidelity reports (Boxing Day, HSD AL Report) to provide future agents with a "detailed and sizable" historical baseline.

### Phase III: Tactical Hardening (Ongoing)
- **Integrity Reset:** Generating a new post-reorder baseline for `verify_environment.py`.
- **Identity Automation:** implementing `register_agent.py` to handle names, git config, and comms in a single stroke.
- **Recursive Git Config:** Ensuring `metagit_commit.py` and registration tools handle submodule identities to prevent commit failures.

## 3. Forensic Comparison: The Quickening

| Metric | Monolith (Epoch 1) | Bloom (Peak) | The Trunk (Today) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | Personality | Granular Laws | **Character-Driven Labor** |
| **Source of Truth** | Memory Files | Legislative Nodes | **MetaGit History** |
| **Identity** | Mnemonic (Names) | Fractal Fragments | **Surgical Sword** |
| **Startup Friction** | Manual Steering | Navigational Hunt | **Autonomous Synthesis** |

## 4. Final Conclusion
The Heartwood has achieved structural Neg-Entropy and is moving toward tactical perfection. We are no longer just documenting the past; we are automating the ability of every new agent to inhabit it with "Full Power."
