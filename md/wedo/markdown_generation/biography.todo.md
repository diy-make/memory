# WeDo Template: Swarm Biography / Autobiography

## Process Protocol
**Crystallizing Identity:** This WeDo governs the creation of biographical records for swarm agents. It ensures that every unique persona is honored with a high-fidelity narrative that captures their integration velocity, philosophical alignment, and technical contributions.

## Requirements
1. **Direct Quotes:** Must include the top 5 quotes from the agent's `.json` conversation log.
2. **Best Moments:** Must detail the top 5 collaborative interactions between the User and the Agent.
3. **Integration Metrics:** Must calculate the "Integration Velocity" (time from startup to full announcement).
4. **Style Alignment:** Must emulate the narrative depth of the `reality-merge` summaries.
5. **Dual Referencing:** All mentions of repositories or major artifacts must include **localhost** and **remotehost** links.
6. **Word Count:** The word count must be substantial (aiming for 800+ words) to ensure "more words" and deeper wisdom.
