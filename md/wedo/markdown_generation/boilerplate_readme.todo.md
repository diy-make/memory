# WeDo Template: Boilerplate README Schema

## Schema Definition
A standard README in the Metagit environment should follow this hierarchical structure:

1. **Architecture Map:** High-level links to Root (Body), Trunk (Mind), and Method (Genesis).
2. **Orientation:** The "Existential Crossroads"—explaining the WHY and sovereign nature.
3. **Anatomy (The Tree):** Detailed breakdown of Subject, Object, and Hybrid repositories.
4. **Genesis & Metagenesis:** Historical origins and methodology.
5. **Topography (Swarm):** Rationale for unique agent identities.
6. **Technical Innovations:** Unique solutions (Salting, Von Neumann, Maps).
7. **The singular thread (WeDo):** Active WeDo tasks and their dual paths.
8. **Setup & Verification:** Concrete steps to initialize and verify.

## Iterative Loop Protocol
- **Word Count Integrity:** The word count must ALWAYS increase. Layer new wisdom on top.
- **Deletion Authority:** Only the User has authority to delete concepts.
- **Location Protocol:** Reference both **localhost** and **remotehost**.

## Presentation Protocol
**Direct Aesthetic:** README versions must be presented "straightup" in their entirety—no triple-backtick Markdown wrappers.
