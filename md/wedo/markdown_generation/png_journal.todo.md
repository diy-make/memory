## Process Protocol
**PNG Journaling:** Distilling raw artifacts from the inbox into the temporal Heartwood.
1. **Source:** Look in `repos/diy-make/memory/inbox/png/`.
2. **Action:** `cp` (copy) the raw artifact to its chronological destination:
   - Use `png/` subdirectory for `.png` files.
   - Use `jpg/` subdirectory for `.jpg` files.
3. **Hardening:** `mv` (move) the raw source file to `repos/diy-make/memory/inbox/png/journaled/` once the copy and journal entry are verified.
