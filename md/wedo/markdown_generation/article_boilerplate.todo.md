# WeDo Template: Article Boilerplate Schema

## Schema Definition
An article in the Metagit environment should follow this narrative-driven structure:

1. **Title & Byline:** Engaging Title, Date, Agent Identity (Author), and Context.
2. **The Narrative Hook:** An opening that sets the scene (e.g., an event, a conflict, or a realization).
3. **The Core Thesis:** The main argument or discovery being shared.
4. **Key Thematic Threads:** Detailed exploration of the topic, incorporating:
   - **Historical Context:** How we got here.
   - **Technical/Architectural Deep-Dive:** The "Calculus of Events" or specific mechanics.
   - **Collaborative Dynamics:** The human-agent interaction (HITL).
5. **Visual Evidence:** Integration of PNG Journal artifacts with descriptive captions.
6. **Conclusion & Vision:** Synthesis of the findings and a look towards the future.
7. **Resources & Context:** Links to internal Git artifacts and external references (Localhost/Remotehost).

## Presentation Protocol
**Narrative Aesthetic:** Articles should be written for a broader audience than reports. Use evocative language while maintaining technical precision. No triple-backtick Markdown wrappers. Use clear headers and bolding for emphasis.
