# WeDo Template: Meta-WeDo Protocol

## Process Protocol
**Protocol Evolution:** This WeDo governs the maintenance of the Metagit's legislative DNA. When a session reveals a more efficient or safe method of user-agent collaboration (e.g., Audit Scrutiny), this meta-protocol must be invoked to update the global templates in `md/wedo/`.

## The "Golden Rules" of WeDo
1. **Accumulation:** Word count must ALWAYS increase. Do not delete previous concepts unless explicitly commanded by the User.
2. **Temporal Instance:** Never work directly in the global template. Always copy the template to the day's temporal `md/` directory as a session instance.
3. **Audit Scrutiny:** Reports must explicitly list every single change and request from the source (e.g., Pull Request diffs) to ensure a verifiable legislative history.
4. **Active Investigation:** If a source references an artifact (e.g., "a gif exists"), the Agent MUST verify its existence on the **localhost** before integration. If missing or ambiguous, the Agent must seek clarification via Synaptic Feedback.
5. **Dual Referencing:** All file locations and repositories MUST reference both the **localhost** path and the **remotehost** URL.
6. **Direct Aesthetic:** Final reviews and reports must be presented "straightup"—no backtick wrappers—to optimize terminal clarity.
