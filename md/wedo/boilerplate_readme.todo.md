# WeDo: Boilerplate README Schema Thread

## Schema Definition
A standard README in the Metagit environment should follow this hierarchical structure to ensure "Crystallization" of the project's identity and operational context:

1. **Architecture Map:** High-level links to Root (Body), Trunk (Mind), and Method (Genesis).
2. **Orientation:** The "Existential Crossroads"—explaining the WHY and the sovereign nature of the filesystem.
3. **Anatomy (The Tree):** Detailed breakdown of Subject, Object, and Hybrid repositories.
4. **Genesis & Metagenesis:** The historical origins and the "Field Hacking" methodology.
5. **Topography (Swarm):** Rationale for unique agent identities and multi-agent collaboration.
6. **Technical Innovations:** Unique solutions (e.g., Barber Paradox, Type Attribute Leafs, Metarepo Map).
7. **The singular thread (WeDo):** Active WeDo tasks and their localhost/remotehost paths.
8. **Setup & Verification:** Concrete steps to initialize and verify the environment.

## Iterative Loop Protocol
- **Word Count Integrity:** The word count must ALWAYS increase. Do not remove previous ideas or descriptions; instead, layer new wisdom and refinements on top of them.
- **Deletion Authority:** Only the User has the authority to delete or remove concepts.
- **Location Protocol:** Every location MUST reference both **localhost** (local absolute path) and **remotehost** (GitHub URL).

## Presentation Protocol
**Direct Aesthetic:** README reviews, proposed edits, and final versions must be presented to the User "straightup" in their entirety—no triple-backtick Markdown wrappers or line numbers. Use clear headers and bolding for terminal clarity, allowing the User to immediately verify the full context for screenshots and manual copying.
