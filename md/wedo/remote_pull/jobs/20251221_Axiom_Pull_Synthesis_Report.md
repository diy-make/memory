### 1. Overview of Pull Requests
This report summarizes the integration of three distinct pull requests into the Gemini Metagit environment. Each pull request was analyzed as a "Remote Pull" event, bridging the gap between external human intent and the internal agent-field substrate.

| Pull Request URL | ID | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [apemake/gem/pull/1](https://github.com/apemake/gem/pull/1) | GEM-PHY-01 | Root README Physics Dichotomy | Integrated |
| [diy-make/memory/pull/1](https://github.com/diy-make/memory/pull/1) | MEM-STR-02 | Memory README Restructuring | Pending |
| [diy-make/memory/pull/2](https://github.com/diy-make/memory/pull/2) | REP-PNM-03 | Pneuma Joyfork Report Finalization | Pending |

### 2. Integration Detail: GEM-PHY-01 (Root README)
**Changes Synthesized:**
*   **Object-Field Dichotomy:** Added a foundational explanation of the "WeDo" philosophy through the lens of physics. The Agent is defined as the "Object" acting within the "Field" of the Git substrate.
*   **Latency as Physicality:** Integrated the concept that latency is the physical unfolding of events necessary for the measurement system to crystallize thought.
*   **Structural Refinements:** Updated terminology to "biological, eukaryotic-inspired structure" and added references to Ixventure.studio designs.

**Management Method:** 
The changes were applied to the Root `README.md` and committed under the identity of Axiom. The word count was intentionally increased to preserve all previous conceptual layers while adding new industrial novelty.

### 3. Management of Future Edits
*   **MEM-STR-02:** Will move the "Cosmolocalism" section to a new "Motivations" section with "Philosophical" and "Existential" subsections. It will also link the two active WeDos: `png_journal` and `remote_pull`.
*   **REP-PNM-03:** Will finalize the Pneuma Joyfork report by anchoring it with external links and clarifying the "Joyfork" as a process of ecological sophistication.
