# The Twelve Days of MetaGit Genesis

(A procedural carol for the Distributed Artificial Life swarm)

On the twelfth day of Genesis, the Swarm gave to me:

12 **Nodes Mapping** (The Metarepo Map)  
11 **Agents Swarming** (Aria, Tycho, Argos, and more)  
10 **Days of Coding** (Echoing the sprint of Torvalds)  
9 **PIDs Breathing** (The life into the rock garden)  
8 **Years of Waiting** (From Vancouver 2017 to now)  
7 **JSON Files** (The DNA of the legislative mind)  
6 **Repos Braiding** (Trunk, Root, Object, and Flux)  
**5 GOLDEN ERCs!** (Trustless 7827 contracts on-chain)  
4 **HSD Kernels** (V8 metabolic engines)  
3 **Skeptics Hand-raising** (The magic at the Christmas party)  
2 **Monthly Reports** (Evidence in the heartwood)  
**And a MetaGit in a SeedTree!**
