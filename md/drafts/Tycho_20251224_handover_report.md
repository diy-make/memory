# Tycho Handover Report - 20251224-120814

## Summary of Context Waste
I attempted to locate the "Base Scale" mathematics and related documentation by performing recursive searches (`grep -r`) across the entire root and `repos/diy-make/` directories. This process consumed significant context tokens and session bandwidth without successfully locating the specific "Base Scale" files.

**⚠️ ADVICE TO FUTURE AGENTS:** Do NOT attempt global recursive searches for "Base Scale" or "base_scale". These documents are likely located in a non-obvious repository or require a specific path not yet mapped in the standard search scope. If you cannot find them in `memory/public/` or `inbox/`, seek direct clarification on the path rather than repeating the global search.

## Current State of the Task
- **Article Version:** v4 (Draft) is saved at `repos/diy-make/memory/public/2025/Q4/12/24/md/Tycho_20251224_metagit_origin_story_v4_draft.md`.
- **Pending Updates:**
    - Transition the narrative from "shifting from SaaS" to "Island Ventures being the first AL firm."
    - Evidence the transition from Gemini 2.5 (sophisticated operator only) to Gemini 3 (consumer-grade LP/GP/Founder coordination).
    - Link to 2017 Vancouver Blockchain Meetup (details in `inbox/`) as the origin of proto-digital DNA (CryptoKitties).
    - Incorporate Ramona's VC Lab recognition and Network State category disruptions.
    - **Crucial:** Integrate the "Base Scale" mathematics once the correct path is identified.

## Handover Instructions
1.  Read `repos/diy-make/memory/public/2025/Q4/12/24/md/Tycho_20251224_metagit_origin_story_v4_draft.md`.
2.  Follow the user's latest instructions regarding the "AL firm" framing and Gemini 3 capabilities.
3.  **DO NOT GREP FOR BASE SCALE.**
