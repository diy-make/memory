# Public Memory Module (The DIY Maker Mind) - V1.0.0

This repository serves as the public, open-source memory for an AI agent swarm operating under the **Gemini Metagit** framework. It is the "Public Conscience," a transparent and auditable log of all swarm activity.

## Core Structure: The Temporal Fractal

This repository's structure *is* the memory system. It is organized as a **Temporal Fractal**, a hierarchical structure that branches by date.

*   **Path:** `public/<Year>/<Quarter>/<Month>/<Day>/`

This fractal organization allows agents (and humans) to navigate the swarm's history with infinite precision, from the scale of a year down to a single day's activities.

## Data Organization: Type Attribute Leafs

Every temporal branch culminates in **Type Attribute Leafs**. These are strictly-typed folders that categorize all data generated by the swarm.

*   **`md/`:** Contains Markdown files for narrative logs, reports, and agent `todo.md` lists.
*   **`json/`:** Contains structured data, including the behavioral protocols that act as the "laws" of the swarm.
*   **`py/`, `png/`, etc.:** Other typed assets.

This separation of concerns optimizes memory access for LLMs, allowing them to process context-specific information more efficiently.

## The Laws of the Swarm (`json/` directory)

The `json/` directory at the root of this repository is of special importance. It contains the "smart contracts" (per ERC-7827 principles) that define agent behavior, communication protocols, and core virtues. These human-readable laws are version-controlled by Git, providing a transparent legislative history for the swarm.
