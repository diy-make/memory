![001-zion-initiates-public-repo-stabilization.png](../png/001-zion-initiates-public-repo-stabilization.png)
- **Description:** Terminal view showing Agent Zion accepting a new objective: stabilize the `public/` memory module for publication. Zion outlines a 4-step plan to audit core files, calculate checksums, and create a specialized `verify_environment.py` script for the submodule.
- **Key Takeaway:** Shifting focus to submodule integrity. The agent applies the lessons from the root stabilization to the nested memory modules.

- **Description:** Terminal view where Zion defends the architectural choice of keeping `requirements.txt` and `.venv` separate for each repository. He argues this approach ensures "Separation of Concerns" and prevents dependency conflicts between the orchestration layer and specific memory modules.
- **Key Takeaway:** Architectural integrity. The agent provides a logical defense for a decoupled environment structure.

- **Description:** Terminal view showing a successful refactor commit in the `public/` repository. Zion has reorganized various markdown reports into their proper chronological subdirectories (`2025/Q4/12/13/md/`) and updated the verification script accordingly.
- **Key Takeaway:** Maintaining chronological order. The agent proactively cleans up the repository's narrative structure.

- **Description:** Terminal view displaying Zion's high-level analysis of the `reality-merge/` Git history. He categorizes the project's evolution into three phases: Setup & Refactoring, AI Collaboration & Documentation, and Maintenance & Link Rot.
- **Key Takeaway:** Forensic narrative reconstruction. The agent synthesizes a complex Git history into a coherent chronological story.

![007-zion-analyzes-reality-merge-phase-1.png](../png/007-zion-analyzes-reality-merge-phase-1.png)
- **Description:** Terminal view showing Zion's detailed analysis of Phase 1 of the `reality-merge/` project. He identifies this phase as "Setting the Stage (Commits 1-5)," focusing on the initialization of the repository, the creation of the core directory structure, and the establishment of the early markdown guidelines.
- **Key Takeaway:** Deep forensic reconstruction of project origins. The agent documents the foundational commits that defined the initial topography of the knowledge base.

- **Description:** Terminal view showing the initialization of Agent GeminiSage. The image captures the successful execution of the environment verification script, confirming that the V1 architecture baseline is stable and that all core dependencies are present.
- **Key Takeaway:** Swarm continuity and reliable onboarding. The image documents the transition to a new agent persona while maintaining a verified technical foundation.

- **Description:** Terminal view showing GeminiSage auditing legacy scripts in the `py/` directory. The agent is seen reviewing `dspy_startup.py` and `dspy_simple_orchestrator.py` to identify hardcoded paths that need to be refactored for the V1 metagit architecture.
- **Key Takeaway:** Technical debt identification. The agent systematically audits existing tools to ensure they align with the new architectural standards of flexibility and universality.

- **Description:** Terminal view showing GeminiSage defining the active roles of the `public/` memory module. The agent lists five key responsibilities: Rule Management, Agent Navigation, Filesystem Management, Chat Processing, and Screenshot Processing, reframing the repository as a dynamic engine rather than a static store.
