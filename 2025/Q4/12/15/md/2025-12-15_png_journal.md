![001-zion-initiates-public-repo-stabilization.png](../png/001-zion-initiates-public-repo-stabilization.png)
- **Description:** Terminal view showing Agent Zion accepting a new objective: stabilize the `public/` memory module for publication. Zion outlines a 4-step plan to audit core files, calculate checksums, and create a specialized `verify_environment.py` script for the submodule.
- **Key Takeaway:** Shifting focus to submodule integrity. The agent applies the lessons from the root stabilization to the nested memory modules.

- **Description:** Terminal view capturing a pivot in strategy. Zion realizes the complexity of the `public/` repository requires a more robust, phased approach than initially planned. He discards the "naive" plan in favor of a multi-phase system starting with foundational structure verification.
- **Key Takeaway:** Adaptive planning. The agent recognizes system complexity and upgrades its technical strategy to match.

- **Description:** Terminal view showing the first execution of the public repo's `verify_environment.py`. The script confirms the existence of top-level directories (`json/`, `md/`, `py/`, `todo/`) and the internal JSON hierarchy, achieving a version 1.0.0 baseline.
- **Key Takeaway:** Successful implementation of sub-repository verification tooling.

- **Description:** Terminal view where Zion defends the architectural choice of keeping `requirements.txt` and `.venv` separate for each repository. He argues this approach ensures "Separation of Concerns" and prevents dependency conflicts between the orchestration layer and specific memory modules.
- **Key Takeaway:** Architectural integrity. The agent provides a logical defense for a decoupled environment structure.

- **Description:** Terminal view showing a successful refactor commit in the `public/` repository. Zion has reorganized various markdown reports into their proper chronological subdirectories (`2025/Q4/12/13/md/`) and updated the verification script accordingly.
- **Key Takeaway:** Maintaining chronological order. The agent proactively cleans up the repository's narrative structure.

- **Description:** Terminal view displaying Zion's high-level analysis of the `reality-merge/` Git history. He categorizes the project's evolution into three phases: Setup & Refactoring, AI Collaboration & Documentation, and Maintenance & Link Rot.
- **Key Takeaway:** Forensic narrative reconstruction. The agent synthesizes a complex Git history into a coherent chronological story.
