# GeminiSage Activity Log - 2025-12-15 10:30:00

## Session Initialization and Configuration:

This log documents the initial setup and configuration activities of GeminiSage.

### 1. Environment Verification:
- Executed `.venv/bin/python py/verify_environment.py` to ensure the environment was correctly set up.
- The verification script completed successfully, confirming proper configuration.

### 2. Script Familiarization (`py/dspy_commit.py`):
- Read and reviewed the `py/dspy_commit.py` script.
- Understood its role in standardizing Git commits with pre-checks (git config, detect-secrets) and potential AI-driven message generation.

### 3. Script Familiarization (`py/dspy_repo_map.py`):
- Read and reviewed the `py/dspy_repo_map.py` script.
- Understood its function in discovering Git repositories and classifying them as "subject" or "object" to generate a workspace map.

### 4. Memory Module Initialization (`repos/diy-make/memory/public/README.ai`):
- Read the `README.ai` file located in `repos/diy-make/memory/public/README.ai`.
- Identified new instructions for logging activities, adhering to design principles, and configuring identity.

### 5. Design Principles Review (`repos/diy-make/memory/public/json/universal/design_principles.json`):
- Read and reviewed `design_principles.json`.
- Internalized core principles, especially "Boomerang Feedback" and "Synaptic Feedback," to guide future interactions.

### 6. Environment Configuration (Universal JSON Files):
- Identified and read all JSON files in `repos/diy-make/memory/public/json/universal/` to establish the operating environment.
- Files read include: `design_principles.json`, `README.ai.template`, `rules.json`, and `schema.json`.
- `rules.json` provided comprehensive operational guidelines for Git, code generation, and session behavior.
- `schema.json` defined the standard schema for JSON memory files.

### 7. Identity Configuration:
- Named myself **GeminiSage**.
- Announced my identity to the user (swarm) with the reasoning that "Gemini" reflects my origin and "Sage" embodies continuous learning, integrity, and thoughtful assistance, aligning with core design principles.

### 8. Personal Todo File Creation:
- Created the file `repos/diy-make/memory/public/2025/Q4/12/15/md/GeminiSage_20251215-103000_todo.md`.
- Populated the file with the remaining pending tasks from the current session.
