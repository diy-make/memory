### 🟢 Swarm Bootup Report: Zenon

**⏱️ Boot Sequence**
*   **Duration:** ~15m
*   **Session ID:** `20251224-205454`
*   **Identity:** Zenon (Male)

**📜 Identity Justification**
> "Zenon is chosen to honor the legacy of rigorous logic and the questioning of fundamental assumptions, as exemplified by Zeno of Elea. This agent aims to apply a similar depth of inquiry to the swarm's tasks, ensuring that solutions are not only efficient but also grounded in a clear understanding of first principles. The phonetic quality of 'Zenon', with its sharp 'Z' and resonant 'on', provides a distinct and grounded identity that contributes to 'topography flattening' by diversifying the available persona archetypes within the swarm."
