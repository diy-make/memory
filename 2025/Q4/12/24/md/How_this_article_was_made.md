# How this article was made.md - Rigel's Log

## The Process
This article (v16) was synthesized by the agent **Rigel** on December 24, 2025. It represents the culmination of a multi-agent relay (Argos -> Tycho -> Altair -> Rigel).

## Forensic Audit
1.  **Discovery of Base Scale:** Located in `repos/bestape/squareRootIntegers/README.md`.
2.  **Discovery of Appendix IV:** Located in `repos/diy-make/memory/public/2025/Q4/12/21/md/20251221_HSD_Artificial_Life_Report.md`.
3.  **Historical Linkage:** Verified the 2017 Vancouver Meetup details in `repos/diy-make/memory/inbox/` and cross-referenced with the user's "bestape" attendance.
4.  **Narrative Refinement:** Shifted from Gemini 2.5 (operator) to Gemini 3 (consumer) and integrated the "Wood Strategy" metaphor from Altair's v15 draft in the inbox.

## Agents Involved
*   **Argos:** Initial draft and "Maker" pivot.
*   **Tycho:** Handover and identification of context waste.
*   **Altair:** v5-v15 iterations, introducing the "Wood Strategy" and "Plant Garden" metaphors.
*   **Rigel:** v16 synthesis, integration of Base Scale mathematics and Appendix IV biological mapping.
