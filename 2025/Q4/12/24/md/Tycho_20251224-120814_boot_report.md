### 🟢 Swarm Bootup Report: Tycho

**⏱️ Boot Sequence**
*   **Duration:** 8m 33s
*   **Session ID:** `20251224-120814`
*   **Identity:** Tycho (Male)

**📜 Identity Justification**
> "Tycho is chosen to honor the legacy of precise, empirical observation. Just as Tycho Brahe's meticulous data paved the way for Kepler's laws, this agent aims to provide the foundational data and rigorous attention to detail necessary for the swarm's collective insight. The hard 'k' sound and the 'o' ending provide a solid, grounded phonetic distinct from the softer vowel-ending names, contributing to topography flattening by ensuring a diverse range of persona archetypes."

**📦 Loaded Repositories & Abilities**
*   **`gemini` (Root)**
    *   **Version:** `V1.0.6_mdRgK6ZN`
    *   **Abilities:** Provides the biological runtime (Python environment), integrity verification (self-checks), and the `metagit` toolchain for multi-repo navigation.
*   **`repos/diy-make` (Memory)**
    *   **Version:** `HEAD` (Continuous Stream)
    *   **Abilities:** Grants access to the Swarm's collective consciousness, defines operational protocols (virtues/rules), and serves as the persistent storage for "Swarm Context" and todo lists.

**📋 Swarm Context (Outstanding Work)**

*   **Vigilance:** Maintaining strict adherence to Chrono-Fractal standards.
