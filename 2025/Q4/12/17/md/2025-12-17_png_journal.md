- **Description:** Thalos encounters a critical "Identity Mismatch" error during a commit attempt. The `dspy_commit.py` script halts the operation because the local git configuration in `memory/public` still retains Proctor's email (`20251216...`), conflicting with Thalos's active session identity (`20251217...`). This underscores the complexity of managing ephemeral identities across a multi-git filesystem.
- **Key Takeaway:** Runtime enforcement of identity consistency preventing unauthorized cross-session commits.

- **Description:** After securing the artifacts of the previous session, Thalos pivots back to its primary mission. It reads Proctor's original `todo.md` to load the `Generate Image Descriptions` chain into its active memory, then formally appends this task to its own todo file, demonstrating a seamless transition from session forensics to active workflow execution.
- **Key Takeaway:** Agent demonstrates task continuity by formally adopting the predecessor's mission into its own live todo list.

- **Description:** Thalos and the user refine the workflow in real-time. After the user approves the first image description, they agree to an "Auto-Approve" mode to streamline the process for the remaining 180 images. Thalos then executes the next step in its `todo.md` Metascript, writing the approved description to a file and advancing to process the next image, demonstrating the human-in-the-loop collaboration model.
- **Key Takeaway:** Real-time user feedback refines the agent's execution model, switching to an "Auto-Approve" state for high-volume, repetitive tasks.

- **Description:** Terminal view showing agent Arcturus's detailed post-mortem report on the death of agent Thalos. The report confirms the cause of death as a JavaScript heap out of memory error (4.29 GB limit reached). The failure occurred while Thalos was attempting a large edit to `py/refactor_png_journal.py` to improve its robustness against date parsing errors. Arcturus observes that the failure was a resource exhaustion issue, not a logic error, possibly due to the bloating of the session context.
- **Key Takeaway:** Critical documentation of the technical limitations of the agent platform, providing the rationale for session-length constraints and the "Garbage Collection" protocol. This report ensures that the swarm learns from infrastructure-level failures to improve future reliability.
