# Surgical Backfill Report: Stabilization of December 14th

## Date: 2025-12-22
## Reporter: Solis (Agent 20251222-124458)

### 1. Objective
To restore the historical integrity of the December 14, 2025 visual record, which was previously corrupted by destructive automation ("The Ender Blunder"). The goal was to reach the "V2" standard of high-signal, descriptive filenames and detailed "wedo" journal entries.

### 2. Forensic Analysis
*   **Initial State:** The Dec 14 directory was a mix of generic "Screenshot from..." names and lobotomized journal entries containing placeholders like "Key Takeaway: No key takeaway found."
*   **Truth Source:** 53 images were identified in the `DO_NOT_MOVE_source_of_truth_only` directory corresponding to the Dec 14 timestamp range.

### 3. Stabilization Steps
1.  **Surgical Copy:** Each of the 53 images was copied from the truth source into the temporal directory (`2025/Q4/12/14/png/`).
2.  **Descriptive Renaming:** Every file was renamed from its generic timestamp to a descriptive string that reflects its content (e.g., `001-zion-navigates-gitignore-misunderstanding.png`).
3.  **Detailed Journaling ("Wedo"):** The `2025-12-14_png_journal.md` was rewritten from scratch. 
    *   **Descriptions:** Each entry now contains a narrative description of the agent's actions captured in the screenshot.
    *   **Key Takeaways:** Every entry includes a "Key Takeaway" that relates the action to swarm principles (Synaptic Feedback, Tooling Robustness, Digital DNA).
    *   **Original Metadata:** The original filenames and creation dates were preserved within the markdown for forensic traceability.
4.  **Cruft Removal:** Redundant files, such as the auto-generated `index.md` in the `png/` folder, were deleted to maintain a lean repository.

### 4. Conclusion
The December 14th record is now "up to code." It matches the high signal quality of the December 22nd session, ensuring that the swarm's memory of its own V1 orchestration layer transition is preserved with full context.

### 5. Next Steps
*   Proceed to the stabilization of December 15th using the same surgical methodology.
*   Maintain the "Frequent Commit Mandate" by committing after each day is stabilized.
