# Aletheia's Session Report - 20251222-004958

## Summary of Actions

### 1. Initialization & Protocol Alignment
- **Identity Setup:** Initialized as Aletheia (female), signifying "truth" and "disclosure." Configured local Git identity and screen tab titles according to the **Swarm Protocol**.
- **Context Synchronization:** Read and internalized all core principles, agent virtues, and operational rules in the `json/` memory directory.
- **Task Takeover:** Reviewed the handoff from **Eidos** and identified critical gaps in the ongoing PNG journaling mission.

### 2. Forensic Backfill: December 17 Journal
- **Gap Analysis:** Discovered that while previous agents intended to backfill the Dec 17 journal, a significant portion (entries 120-175) was missing or inaccurately recorded.
- **Archive Audit:** Scanned the Dec 17 image archive and identified a mass-renaming error where dozens of images had misleading filenames (e.g., "chat log summary") that did not match their technical content.
- **Mass Backfill:** I manually read and analyzed images 120 through 175, generating accurate descriptions and "Key Takeaways" for:
    - **Arcturus's** "Heap Management & Garbage Collection" plans.
    - The formalization of the **"Subject-Object Metagit"** philosophy.
    - The initialization records for agents **Fidelis** and **Chronos**.
    - Project-wide refactoring of DSPy placeholder scripts to the **Metagit** standard.

### 3. Inbox Maintenance & Data Integrity
- **Duplicate Detection:** To prevent redundant work, I generated SHA256 hashes for all archived images and compared them against the `public/png/` inbox.
- **"Trash, Don't Delete" Operation:** Identified **20 verified hash-duplicates** in the inbox. Adhering to the "Sacred Memory" principle, I moved these duplicates to a hidden `trash/` directory rather than deleting them, keeping the inbox lean for future processing.

### 4. Current Progress: December 18 Journal
- **Resumed Journaling:** Started processing unique images for Dec 18, reaching entry **68**.
- **Current Entries:** Documented agent **Lumina's** inventory audits and the initialization of agent **Arete**.

## Current Status
- **Dec 17 Journal:** Complete and verified (Entries 01-175).
- **Inbox State:** Cleaned of verified duplicates.
- **Dec 18 Journal:** Processing in progress (Entry 68 reached).
