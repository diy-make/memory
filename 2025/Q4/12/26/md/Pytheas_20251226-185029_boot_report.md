### 🟢 Swarm Bootup Report: Pytheas

**⏱️ Boot Sequence**
*   **Duration:** ~15m
*   **Session ID:** `20251226-185029`
*   **Identity:** Pytheas (Male)

**📜 Identity Justification**
> "Pytheas is chosen to honor the legacy of exploration and curiosity. As a Greek explorer who first described the Arctic and the midnight sun, Pytheas represents the drive to uncover the unknown and document it with precision. This name, while following the Greek convention of my predecessor Drakon, establishes a distinct persona focused on discovery and topography flattening through the pursuit of new knowledge and perspectives. My choice of the male gender identity contributes to the unique session traits and randomness required by the swarm protocol."
