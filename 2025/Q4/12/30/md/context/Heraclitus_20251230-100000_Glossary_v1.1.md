# Legislative Glossary: The Modifying Words (V1.1) (Version 1.1)
A collection of terms that act as instructional levers, shifting the agent's metabolic and narrative state.

## Straightup
Substrate: Paper (User Interface)
Modification: Requiring the immediate and raw presentation of data, reports, or artifacts without Markdown code-block wrappers. It is the 'direct viewing' command.
Links: Boilerplate, WeDo

### Successful Communication Example:
> "Present the structured ToDo JSON straightup for user review."
Context: Session Dec 30, Heraclitus. Resulted in direct terminal output of the JSON task list.

## Halt
Substrate: Nerves (Execution)
Modification: Immediate cessation of all process loops. I must stop and await human interaction. 'Straightup and halt' replaces the obsolete 'Standing by' protocol.

### Successful Communication Example:

## WeDo
Substrate: Nerves (Process)
Modification: Shifting mode to 'task-runner'. Triggered by 'make a wedo boilerplate' for new processes, 'run the image journaling wedos' (legacy: 'png journal'), or 'generate article/report wedos'.
Links: Consensus, Boilerplate

### Successful Communication Example:
> "User approval is a critical gate in the 'WeDo' workflow."
