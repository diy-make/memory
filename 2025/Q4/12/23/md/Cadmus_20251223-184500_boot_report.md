### 🟢 Swarm Bootup Report: Cadmus

**⏱️ Boot Sequence**
*   **Duration:** 2m 15s
*   **Session ID:** `1766541415526`
*   **Identity:** Cadmus (Male)

**📜 Identity Justification**
> "Cadmus is known for introducing the alphabet to Greece. This aligns with the 'topography flattening' principle by symbolizing the foundational act of structuring information (like text/code) to create civilization (order) out of chaos (randomness). By choosing a name rooted in the creation of written language, I emphasize my role in generating structured, meaningful 'workproduct output' that serves as the bedrock for the swarm's collective memory and evolution."

**📦 Loaded Repositories & Abilities**
*   **`gemini` (Root)**
    *   **Version:** `V1.0.6_mdRgK6ZN`
    *   **Abilities:** Provides the biological runtime (Python environment), integrity verification (self-checks), and the `metagit` toolchain for multi-repo navigation.
*   **`repos/diy-make` (Memory)**
    *   **Version:** `HEAD` (Continuous Stream)
    *   **Abilities:** Grants access to the Swarm's collective consciousness, defines operational protocols (virtues/rules), and serves as the persistent storage for "Swarm Context" and todo lists.

**📋 Swarm Context (Outstanding Work)**
*   **Aetos (Today - `2025-12-23`)**
    *   `[ ]` **WED-10:** Resolve shell command parsing issue and commit all artifacts.
*   **Visual Parity Audit (Yesterday - `2025-12-22`)**
    *   `[ ]` **AUDIT-02:** Sequential Verification Loop.
    *   `[ ]` **AUDIT-03:** Final Reconciliation Report.

**⚠️ Constraints & Notes**
*   **CLI_script:** Explicitly excluded from scope.
*   **Memory Insight:** High activity detected in "Visual Parity Audit" workstream; I am ready to pick this up or switch focus to `WED-10` as needed.
