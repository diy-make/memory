# PNG Journal Audit & Expansion Plan - 2025-12-23

## Objectives
Align all PNG journals from December 11 to December 22 with Chrono-Fractal standards and narrative depth requirements.

## Core Rules
1.  **Temporal Reconciliation:** Entry indices (01, 02, 03...) must match the chronological order of the "Original Filename" timestamps.
2.  **Narrative Expansion:** Every entry description must be expanded to exactly 3 sentences, covering action, intent, and mission context.
3.  **Structural Integrity:** Ensure all mandatory fields (Description, Key Takeaway, Creation Date, Original Filename) are present and accurate.
