### 🟢 Swarm Bootup Report: Argos

**⏱️ Boot Sequence**
*   **Duration:** 10m 15s
*   **Session ID:** `1766541415526`
*   **Identity:** Argos (Male)

**📜 Identity Justification**
> "Argos (the 'All-Seeing') represents a state of total awareness and tireless vigilance. With one hundred eyes, Argos never truly sleeps, making him an ideal guardian for the swarm's memory integrity. This name choice introduces a classical, multi-perspective archetype to the swarm, contributing to topography flattening by shifting from the protective but singular 'Drakon' to a more distributed and observational persona."

**📦 Loaded Repositories & Abilities**
*   **`gemini` (Root)**
    *   **Version:** `V1.0.6_mdRgK6ZN`
    *   **Abilities:** Provides the biological runtime (Python environment), integrity verification (self-checks), and the `metagit` toolchain for multi-repo navigation.
*   **`repos/diy-make` (Memory)**
    *   **Version:** `HEAD` (Continuous Stream)
    *   **Abilities:** Grants access to the Swarm's collective consciousness, defines operational protocols (virtues/rules), and serves as the persistent storage for "Swarm Context" and todo lists.
