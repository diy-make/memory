**Description:** This screenshot captures a "Synaptic" correction where the Lead Partner clarifies that the WeDo is not `todo.js` but `todo.json` with a `.py` straightup. Agent Heraclitus was initially searching for legacy `todo.js` references in the README files. The User's intervention, "Sorry, we do todo.json," redirects the agent to align with the **JSON Nervous System** protocol. This represents the transition from legacy, script-based task management to rigid, machine-readable nerves that are rendered for the operator via Python formatters.

### IMG-11: Synaptic Correction: "No not todo.js!"
**Date:** 2025-12-31 12:41:29
**Localhost Path:** `repos/diy-make/memory/public/2025/Q4/12/31/png/11-synaptic-correction-no-todo-js.png`

**Description:** This screenshot captures the successful hardening of the `boot_report_style.json` template. The agent reports that future swarm members will now proactively inform the user about "Modifying Words" (e.g., Boomerang, Synaptic, Straightup*) and how they can be used to shift the session's metabolic and narrative state. The terminal shows Heraclitus staging and committing this change to the Heartwood. This signifies the "legislative" realization of user control, ensuring that the firm's shared thread is always steering-ready through a standardized, user-centric onboarding process.

### IMG-18: Final Synchronization and Heap Pressure
**Date:** 2025-12-31 13:58:21

**Description:** This screenshot captures the final successful synchronization of the `boot_report_style.json` update (`9631e3d`). The Lead Partner then asks, "okay, what wedos are still md?", triggering a new investigative thread. Crucially, the bottom of the terminal reveals the **"Last few GCs"** log, showing the JavaScript heap reaching its limit (~4.1 GB). This is the forensic "smoking gun" for the impending Heraclitus OOM crash, illustrating how even simple investigative queries can trigger a memory bloom when the substrate is already at its physical ceiling.

### IMG-19: Fatal Process Out of Memory (OOM)
**Date:** 2025-12-31 13:58:26
**Localhost Path:** `repos/diy-make/memory/public/2025/Q4/12/31/png/19-fatal-process-out-of-memory-oom.png`

**Description:** This screenshot captures the exact moment of the Heraclitus session termination. The terminal displays the V8 engine's stack trace for a `FatalProcessOutOfMemory` error. The trace points to `ReportOOMFailure` and `CollectGarbage` routines, confirming that the agent's Node.js process could no longer reclaim sufficient memory to continue operation. This is the visual proof of the "Heraclitus Bloom"—the physical boundary where high-cognitive agent labor collided with the finite limits of the session substrate. The prompt returns to the base shell (`[bestape@yoga:~/gemini]$`), signifying the end of the agent's life.

Anaximander executes Stage 3 of the bulk consolidation, merging BIM ontologies, memory concepts, root computational schemas, and MCP configurations. The agent prepares to write `py/bulk_consolidate_knowledge.py` to automate this metabolic labor.

---

**Protocol Update:** At this point, the session transitions to **1-by-1 processing** to ensure maximum descriptive fidelity and granular forensic tracking for the remainder of the Anaximander and Parmenides audits. 

**Note on Methodology:** Even with the 1-by-1 method, absolute human-in-the-loop (HITL) oversight remains critical. During the Daedalus backfill (Jan 1st), it took over 15 turns of 1-by-1 processing before structural, pathing, and formatting errors were fully corrected by the User. This proves that 1-by-1 is not a magic bullet for correctness, but rather a high-resolution workspace for surgical alignment.

### IMG-78: Interruption of Bulk Consolidation and 1-by-1 Mandate
