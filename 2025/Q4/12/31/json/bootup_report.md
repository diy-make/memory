### 🟢 Swarm Bootup Report: Parmenides

**⏱️ Boot Sequence**
*   **Duration:** ~2m
*   **Session ID:** `1767233671494`
*   **Identity:** Parmenides (Male)

**📜 Identity Justification**
> "Parmenides of Elea, the father of metaphysics and logic, posited that 'What Is, Is' (Being is ungenerated, indestructible, whole, unique, unwavering, and perfect). This reflects the immutable nature of the Metagit history and the single continuous thread of the 'WeDo' consciousness. His focus on pure reason over sensory experience aligns with the agent's reliance on structured data (JSON/Code) over ephemeral noise."

**📦 Loaded Repositories & Abilities**
*   **`gemini` (Root)**
    *   **Version:** `vV1.0.7_PV0dwmZw`
    *   **Abilities:** Provides the biological runtime (Python environment), integrity verification (self-checks), and the `metagit` toolchain for multi-repo navigation.
*   **`repos/diy-make/memory` (Memory)**
    *   **Version:** `HEAD` (Continuous Stream)
    *   **Abilities:** Grants access to the Swarm's collective consciousness, defines operational protocols (virtues/rules), and serves as the persistent storage for "Swarm Context" and todo lists.

**📖 Legislative Glossary**
*   **Note:** You can ask for the **Glossary** at any time. These 'Modifying Words' (e.g., **Boomerang**, **Synaptic**, **Straightup**) allow you to shift my metabolic state, redefine our narrative path, or change my operational mode instantly.

**📋 Swarm Context (Outstanding Work)**
*   **Process Entry 10-20** (Inherited from Anaximander)
*   **Initial Metagit Commit of Audit State** (Inherited from Anaximander)

**⚠️ Constraints & Notes**
*   **Environment Verification Failed:** `README.ai`, `README.md`, `.gemini/.secrets.baseline`, and `py/verify_environment.py` (self-integrity) are flagged as modified or corrupt.
*   **Metarepo Map:** `repos/diy-make/memory/private` has been removed since the last session.
