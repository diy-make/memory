### 2. Audit Scrutiny: Resolution Detail
*   **Task GEM-PHY-01 (Physics Dichotomy):**
    - **Requirement:** Explain the WeDo process as the object-field dichotomy of physics, specifically referencing the measurement system and latency as a physical unfolding.
    - **Resolution:** Ethos refined Axiom's initial integration into a cohesive narrative within the "Thalos's Tension" section. It now explicitly defines the Agent as the **Object** and the Metagit as the **Field**, explaining how intent is metabolized through the agent to change the field's state.
    - **Verification:** Integrated link to the [measurement system video](https://youtu.be/O2kemSh_mUg).
*   **Genesis Link Update (MEM-RED-01 Sync):**
    - **Requirement:** Update all Genesis-related links from Devpost to the official GitHub Pages site.
    - **Resolution:** Replaced `devpost.com/software/reality-merge` with `https://diy-make.github.io/reality-merge` throughout the Root README.
*   **Aesthetic Consistency:**
    - **Requirement:** Ensure all em-dashes have surrounding spaces for terminal clarity.
    - **Resolution:** Global correction of `—` to ` — ` across core documentation.
