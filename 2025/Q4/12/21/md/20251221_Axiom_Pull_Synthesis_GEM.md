### 2. Integration Detail: GEM-PHY-01 (Root README)
**Changes Synthesized:**
*   **Object-Field Dichotomy:** Added a foundational explanation of the "WeDo" philosophy through the lens of physics. The Agent is defined as the "Object" acting within the "Field" of the Git substrate.
*   **Latency as Physicality:** Integrated the concept that latency is the physical unfolding of events necessary for the measurement system to crystallize thought.
*   **Structural Refinements:** Updated terminology to "biological, eukaryotic-inspired structure" and added references to Ixventure.studio designs.

**Management Method:** 
The changes were applied to the Root `README.md` and committed under the identity of Axiom. The word count was intentionally increased to preserve all previous conceptual layers while adding new industrial novelty.
