### 2. Audit Scrutiny: PR #1 (Trunk README) Resolution

#### Direct Change Log (from Diff)
*   **Aesthetic Refinement:** Updated "Mind" to "an active, version-controlled 'Mind'".
*   **Genesis/Metagenesis:** Refined "Method" to "Method Deployed" and "Origin" to "Origin Point".
*   **Structural Sections:** Added "THE DESIGN CONSTRAINT," "THE BALANCE," and "ACTIVE WEDOS" (later refined to "UNIQUE WEDOS").

#### WeDo Task Resolutions
*   **MEM-RED-01 (Genesis Links):**
    - **Request:** "link to the GitHub Pages not the devpost. Look to this README.md Git history for the link. Update apemake/gem's README.md too, at localhost:gemini/."
    - **Resolution:** Updated both GEM and MEM READMEs to link to `https://diy-make.github.io/reality-merge`.
*   **MEM-RED-02 (Motivations Restructuring):**
    - **Request:** "move this cosmolocal paragraph to a motivations section, and have this be in its 'philosophical' subsection. Add the existential motivation from the apemake/gem repo to an 'existential' subsection."
    - **Resolution:** Created Section "MOTIVATIONS: THE CONTEXT WINDOW, COSMOLOCALISM & ARTIFICIAL LIFE" with Philosophical, Existential, and Metabolic subsections.
*   **MEM-RED-03 (Context Window & Vending Machines):**
    - **Request:** "Add section about context window... Include context window gif in gif/ as well as this YouTube video... how ineffective LLMs are as vending machines... how cheerbot.org has always been intended as a vending machine."
    - **Resolution:** Created "The Industrial Novelty: Managing the Context Window" subsection. Verified `gif/Context_Window_Limit.gif` exists on localhost and integrated it. Added YouTube reference (https://youtu.be/SpPhm7S9vsQ) and cheerbot rationale.
*   **MEM-RED-04 (Ixventure.studio & Coherent Stack):**
    - **Request:** "Add a section about Ixventure.studio and include subsections about the Hierarchical Script-Database and 7827 there, and how HSD, 7827 and this Metagit relate as a coherent stack."
    - **Resolution:** Added Section 2: "IXVENTURE.STUDIO: THE COHERENT STACK" with HSD and Cosmic ERC-7827 subsections.
*   **MEM-RED-05 (ERC-7827 Immutables):**
    - **Request:** "Include a promise subsection hypothetical 7827 where you pick the best key:value pair in json/ where the value has changed over time... https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8dcbc12efe584e24592d07a81bd6f6450def1052 and https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7827-json-smart-contract-with-value-version-control/21865/3"
    - **Resolution:** Integrated promise subsection within ERC-7827 section with all requested links.
*   **MEM-RED-06 (SeedTreeDB Integration):**
    - **Request:** "Add a promise subsection where we explain how SeedTreeDB.com integrated into the Gemini CLI... will empower Gemini with HSC memory."
    - **Resolution:** Added SeedTreeDB & HSC Memory subsection detailing the DOM/Kernel integration.
*   **MEM-RED-07 (Hard-Won Knowledge Expansion):**
    - **Request:** "Within the HARD-WON KNOWLEDGE section, have this PNG death story be a subsection and add another subsection to explain how the Reality Merge hack story shows why we need Git & Drive systems that are Agent Orchestrated."
    - **Resolution:** Refined Section 3 with "The Death by PNG Incident" and "The Reality Merge Hack Story" subsections.
