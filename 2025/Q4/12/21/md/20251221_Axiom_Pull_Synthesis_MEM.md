### 3. Audit Scrutiny: PR #2 (Joyfork Report) Resolution
*   **Tasks MEM-JOY-01 to 08:**
    - **Requirement:** Refine the report with specific links, quotes, and philosophical anchors (Fractures vs. Expansion, Tokens as Berries).
    - **Resolution:** Ethos performed a narrative integration of all prompts, moving away from verbatim copy-pasting. The report now functions as a cohesive technical and philosophical document.
    - **Verification:** Links to the x402 event and Memberberry syndrome verified and integrated.
