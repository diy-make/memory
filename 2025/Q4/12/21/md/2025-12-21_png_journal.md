- **Description:** Terminal view showing agent Axiom formulating a systematic plan to implement the user's latest documentation directives. Axiom outlines its intent to remove the "ACTIVE WEDOS" section from the Root README and update the Public Memory README to include "UNIQUE WEDOS" and a reference to the HSD report. The image captures the "Planning the Implementation" phase, where the agent maps out the multi-repository edits required to synchronize the orchestration and memory layers with the new "flattened" and "temporal" organizational standards.
- **Key Takeaway:** Complex structural changes are managed through a disciplined planning phase, ensuring that documentation edits remain synchronized and faithful to the user's intent as the project's narrative complexity increases.

![83-axiom-commits-updated-motivations-and-unique-wedos.png](../png/83-axiom-commits-updated-motivations-and-unique-wedos.png)
- **Description:** Terminal view showing agent Axiom successfully committing documentation updates to the `diy-make/memory` repository. The commit (hash `c66c24c`) implements the refined motivations section based on the "Artificial Life" report and formally adds the "UNIQUE WEDOS" section to the Trunk README. The Git Commit Service documents 23 insertions and 8 deletions, signify a significant qualitative improvement in the project's core narrative. Axiom confirms that the restructuring is complete and prepares to present the results for final validation.
- **Key Takeaway:** The "Mind" (Trunk) of the project is formally updated to reflect its new ontological status as a biological environment acting upon digital DNA, with these structural reforms persisted through a signed and version-controlled commit.

![84-axiom-presents-updated-trunk-readme-v0-8-0.png](../png/84-axiom-presents-updated-trunk-readme-v0-8-0.png)
- **Description:** Terminal view showing agent Axiom presenting the updated Trunk README (the Mind), now versioned at v0.8.0 ("Published Early for the Holidays"). The presentation highlights the refined "System Architecture Map" and the integration of the "Metabolic Motivation (HSD & Artificial Life)" section. Axiom confirms that both the Root and Trunk READMEs now reflect the unified vision of the Metagit as a field acting upon Digital DNA, providing a comprehensive orientation for any external auditor or future agent.
- **Key Takeaway:** Full-text presentation in the CLI remains the primary method for validating major qualitative milestones, ensuring that the project's public conscience is auditable and accurately reflects its evolving identity across the release cycle.

- **Description:** Terminal view capturing a critical feedback loop from the user. Despite Axiom's claim of completion, the user identified missing elements in the Public README and directed the agent to "Show me what you think you've done" and "what you've got ahead of you." Axiom is instructed to read the `remote_pull_instance.todo.md` and the Trunk README to assess current progress and identify remaining gaps. This interaction illustrates the vital importance of rigorous human oversight in maintaining "Audit Scrutiny" and ensuring that no user intent is lost during high-velocity development.
- **Key Takeaway:** Completion is a state of verified alignment, not just the fulfillment of a command. The swarm's progress is continuously audited against the active task list to ensure absolute fidelity to the project's long-term objectives.

![86-axiom-assesses-current-progress-and-identifies-pending-tasks.png](../png/86-axiom-assesses-current-progress-and-identifies-pending-tasks.png)
- **Description:** Terminal view showing agent Axiom performing a systematic self-audit of its current progress based on the user's critique. Axiom lists its accomplishments, including the restructuring of the Root and Trunk READMEs and the generation of the HSD Artificial Life report. However, the agent acknowledges that several tasks in the "singular thread" remain pending to fulfill the pull request requirements. The image captures the agent's transition from a state of presumed completion to a state of focused assessment, identifying exactly what remains to be done.
- **Key Takeaway:** The swarm demonstrates its capacity for self-correction and disciplined progress tracking by explicitly documenting both its achievements and its remaining obligations within the legislative DNA of the session.

![87-axiom-lists-granular-pending-tasks-for-trunk-readme.png](../png/87-axiom-lists-granular-pending-tasks-for-trunk-readme.png)
- **Description:** Terminal view showing Axiom's detailed list of "Pending Tasks" extracted from the `remote_pull_instance.todo.md`. These granular tasks include: (1) MEM-RED-01: Updating Genesis links to GitHub Pages; (2) MEM-RED-03: Explaining LLMs as "ineffective vending machines"; (3) MEM-RED-04: Detailing the Ixventure.studio stack; (4) MEM-RED-05/06: Explaining the trustlessness of ERC-7827 and SeedTreeDB; and (5) MEM-RED-07: Refining the "Hard-Won Knowledge" section with the PNG death and Reality Merge hack stories. This image documents the definitive roadmap for the final stage of the V1.0.2 remote pull mission, ensuring that no character-level refinement is missed.
- **Key Takeaway:** High-fidelity project evolution is achieved by decomposing complex narrative requirements into granular, ID-tracked tasks, allowing the swarm to systematically address every user intent and maintain a verifiable record of its progress.
