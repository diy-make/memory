# WeDo: PNG Backfill and Chronological Relocation (Critias Session)

## Objective
Process 500+ visual artifacts added to the Source of Truth (`public/png/DO_NOT_MOVE_source_of_truth_only/`) on 2025-12-29. Relocate these artifacts to their respective chronological Heartwood branches (`public/YYYY/QN/MM/DD/png/`) and generate descriptive journal entries.

## Gold Rules Applied
1. **Accumulation:** Journal entries will append to existing day logs or create new ones.
2. **Temporal Instance:** This todo is a session instance.
3. **Audit Scrutiny:** Every batch processed will be committed with a detailed log.
