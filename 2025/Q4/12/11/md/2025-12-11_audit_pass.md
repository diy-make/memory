## 📝 Auditor Notes
The December 11 journal required significant expansion to meet the 3-sentence narrative standard. Original artifacts for this day are currently absent from the `DO_NOT_MOVE_source_of_truth_only` directory but were verified against the versions in `2025/Q4/12/11/png/`. The chronological flow now correctly reflects the transition from Aetheria's planning to Helia and Morpheus's announcements, concluding with Sophia's self-correction.
