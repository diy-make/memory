*A screenshot of a terminal interface. The AI agent, Aetheria, outlines a comprehensive plan to finalize hackathon documentation. The plan includes updating an overview, creating a summary for Day 7, enhancing a Day 6 summary, and finalizing image organization by executing a previously proposed renaming scheme and ensuring all images are indexed.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** The agent demonstrates strategic, multi-step planning by creating a detailed TODO list to tackle a complex documentation and organization task.

*A screenshot of a terminal showing a list of `mv` commands for renaming generic screenshot files to descriptive names. The commands are grouped by day, and the agent states its intention to create or amend `Screenshots.md` files for each day after renaming.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** The agent demonstrates a systematic approach to data cleanup, batch-renaming files with descriptive names and planning to update corresponding documentation.

**3. Morpheus Swarm Announcement**
![03-morpheus-swarm-announcement.png](../../png/03-morpheus-swarm-announcement.png)
*A screenshot of a terminal showing an agent named Morpheus announcing its presence to the swarm. The agent creates a JSON file with its name, gender, PID, chat log path, timestamp, and a justification for its name choice, which is related to shaping reality and dreams. It then proceeds to configure its Git identity.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** This image documents the agent initialization process, showing how a new agent (Morpheus) creates its identity and communicates its existence to the swarm, adhering to the established protocol.

*A screenshot of a Telegram chat conversation. The participants are discussing logistics for visiting a venue called 'frontier tower' in San Francisco. They coordinate meeting times and discuss checking with a contact named Xenofon about event space availability.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** This screenshot provides real-world context for an event being planned, showing the logistical coordination and key contacts involved.

**5. Helia Swarm Announcement**
![05-helia-swarm-announcement.png](../../png/05-helia-swarm-announcement.png)
*A screenshot of a terminal showing the agent Helia creating its swarm announcement file. The agent, named after a genus of butterfly, justifies its name by referencing the 'Ephemeral Identity' principle of the swarm. It then prepares to add its name to the `used_agent_names.json` file.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** This documents another agent's (Helia) adherence to the swarm initialization protocol, specifically highlighting the 'Ephemeral Identity' principle as a core tenet of its chosen persona.

**6. Sophia Self-Corrects Todo List**
![06-sophia-self-corrects-todo-list.png](../../png/06-sophia-self-corrects-todo-list.png)
*A screenshot of a terminal showing the agent Sophia self-correcting an error. The agent receives an 'Invalid parameters' error for trying to set two tasks as 'in_progress' simultaneously in its todo list. It acknowledges the mistake, reviews the swarm protocol, and corrects its todo list to have only one 'in_progress' task before proceeding.*
*   **Key Takeaway:** The agent demonstrates self-correction by identifying a protocol violation (multiple 'in_progress' tasks), understanding the error, and rectifying its state before continuing its main objective of choosing a name.
