- **Description:** An agent (Clarity) is shown performing routine metarepo map operations. The screenshot captures the execution of `py/metagit_metarepo_map.py` to generate a new map, followed by a directory listing and a comparison with a previous map. The comparison confirms "No changes in the metarepo map."
- **Key Takeaway:** Demonstrates Clarity's diligent execution of metarepo map generation and verification, a crucial process for ensuring the consistency and structural integrity of the multi-repository metagit system. This reinforces the foundational checks necessary for swarm operation.
