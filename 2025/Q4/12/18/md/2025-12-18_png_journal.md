- **Description:** An agent (Chronos) is seen initiating the task of locating Agent Fidelis's specific `todo.md` file within the December 17 markdown directory. The agent acknowledges that this older version lacks the try-catch error handling and plans a step-by-step execution to resume the journaling task.
- **Key Takeaway:** Historical recovery of task context (Fidelis's todo) to maintain continuity in the PNG journaling process across agent sessions.

- **Description:** An agent (Chronos) has analyzed Fidelis's todo list and determined that while the specific "wedo" workflow wasn't in Fidelis's file, the failure likely stemmed from the standard PNG journaling process. Chronos confirms that the *current* boilerplate `todo.md` (which they are using) *does* have the new try-catch error handling. The agent then proceeds to list the `png/` inbox to begin processing, confident in the improved resilience of the workflow.
- **Key Takeaway:** Verification of improved protocol (error handling) before resuming a previously failed task, ensuring system stability.
