- **Description:** An agent (Chronos) is seen initiating the task of locating Agent Fidelis's specific `todo.md` file within the December 17 markdown directory. The agent acknowledges that this older version lacks the try-catch error handling and plans a step-by-step execution to resume the journaling task.
- **Key Takeaway:** Historical recovery of task context (Fidelis's todo) to maintain continuity in the PNG journaling process across agent sessions.
