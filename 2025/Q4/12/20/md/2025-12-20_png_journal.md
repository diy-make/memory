- **Description:** A screenshot of the terminal where Pneuma initiates the requested protocol updates. She identifies that the PNG journal boilerplate already contains a note about 5-image commits and plans to make it a formal numbered step. The agent then shifts focus to the `wedo` and `personal todo` schemas, identifying relevant reports (`Kaelo_20251218_wedo_schema_report.md`) and planning to search for formal JSON schema files in the `json/schema/` directory.
- **Key Takeaway:** Demonstrates the agent's ability to interpret high-level user instructions, identify the relevant files across different formats (markdown and JSON), and formulate a plan to formalize new swarm protocols.

- **Description:** A screenshot of the terminal where Pneuma is formalizing the "5-image commit" rule in the `png_journal_wedo/todo.md` boilerplate. The diff view shows the addition of `STEP 3g: **CONDITIONAL COMMIT:** If 'new_sequential_number' is a multiple of 5...`. The agent also notes that the personal todo format is likely defined by convention rather than a formal schema and plans to check `README.ai`.
- **Key Takeaway:** Demonstrates the practical application of lessons learned during the session to improve the swarm's future efficiency and data safety. By codifying the frequent commit strategy, the agent ensures that future journaling jobs are more resilient to crashes or context loss.

- **Description:** A screenshot of the terminal interface where Pneuma is formalizing the "task indexing" requirement in the `wedo_pseudolanguage_schema.json`. The diff view shows the updated description for the `id` field: "This MUST include an index or numbering system to allow users to cite and reference specific tasks in chat (e.g., 'Please retry step IMG-03b'). This is the primary key for tracking progress." The status message "Counting electrons..." and memory usage of 2.66 GB reflect the intense focus on this structural refinement.
- **Key Takeaway:** Marks the successful implementation of the user's request to enable citation and reference within the swarm's communication. By making the `id` field a mandatory primary key for progress tracking, the agent significantly enhances the auditability and interactivity of future swarm operations.

![135-tantor-confirming-self-integrity-failure-of-verification-script.png](../png/135-tantor-confirming-self-integrity-failure-of-verification-script.png)
- **Description:** A screenshot where Tantor runs the `verify_environment.py` script again. This time, the checksum for `settings.json` is correct (as it was restored), but the "Self-Integrity" check at Step 6 fails because the script itself has been modified. The environment is still reported as having configuration issues.
- **Key Takeaway:** Highlights the multi-layered security architecture of the metagit, where scripts not only verify other files but also monitor their own integrity to prevent unauthorized or undocumented changes to the verification logic itself.
