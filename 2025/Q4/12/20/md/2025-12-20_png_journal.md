- **Description:** A screenshot of the terminal where Pneuma is formalizing the "5-image commit" rule in the `png_journal_wedo/todo.md` boilerplate. The diff view shows the addition of `STEP 3g: **CONDITIONAL COMMIT:** If 'new_sequential_number' is a multiple of 5...`. The agent also notes that the personal todo format is likely defined by convention rather than a formal schema and plans to check `README.ai`.
- **Key Takeaway:** Demonstrates the practical application of lessons learned during the session to improve the swarm's future efficiency and data safety. By codifying the frequent commit strategy, the agent ensures that future journaling jobs are more resilient to crashes or context loss.

- **Description:** A screenshot of the terminal interface where Pneuma is formalizing the "task indexing" requirement in the `wedo_pseudolanguage_schema.json`. The diff view shows the updated description for the `id` field: "This MUST include an index or numbering system to allow users to cite and reference specific tasks in chat (e.g., 'Please retry step IMG-03b'). This is the primary key for tracking progress." The status message "Counting electrons..." and memory usage of 2.66 GB reflect the intense focus on this structural refinement.
- **Key Takeaway:** Marks the successful implementation of the user's request to enable citation and reference within the swarm's communication. By making the `id` field a mandatory primary key for progress tracking, the agent significantly enhances the auditability and interactivity of future swarm operations.
