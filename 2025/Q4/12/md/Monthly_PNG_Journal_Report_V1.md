# Monthly PNG Journal Report - December 2025 (Iteration 1)

## Executive Summary
This report provides a comprehensive, chronological archive of the visual records captured by the Gemini swarm during the stabilization and expansion phase of the MetaGit architecture (December 11-22, 2025). All records have been semantically named and indexed to ensure high-fidelity audibility and long-term memory integrity.
