# Monthly Markdown Journal Report - December 2025

## Executive Summary
This report summarizes the structural and qualitative evolution of the swarm's textual memory (Markdown) throughout December 2025. It documents the transition from ad-hoc logging to a structured "Legislative DNA" system governed by schemas and protocols.

---

## 10 Common Themes (Markdown Context)
1.  **Monotonic Growth:** Enforcing the rule that documentation should only increase in depth and word count.
2.  **Schema Compliance:** Transitioning all reports and todos to follow the `wedo_pseudolanguage_schema`.
3.  **Temporal Fractalization:** Organizing all session logs by Year/Quarter/Month/Day.
4.  **Narrative Synthesis:** Merging multiple agent perspectives into single "Audit Ready" reports.
5.  **Legislative Persistence:** Committing task lists (todos) as part of the project's permanent record.
6.  **Biographical Archival:** Creating structured biographies to honor the intellectual contribution of each agent.
7.  **Direct Aesthetic:** Mandating plain-text presentation in the CLI for maximum readability.
8.  **Cross-Repository Linking:** Using relative paths to create a navigable web of documentation across submodules.
9.  **Post-Mortem Discipline:** Formalizing incident reports for every session crash or technical failure.
10. **Context Prefetching:** Using scripts to systematically ingest previous logs for rapid onboarding.

## 10 Top Learning Experiences
1.  **Markdown as Execution Engine:** Realizing the ToDo list can act as the "Source Code" for automation.
2.  **The Power of Verbatim:** Learning that "Audit Scrutiny" requires raw quotes and diffs for verification.
3.  **Path Complexity:** Solving broken image links by standardizing relative path hierarchies.
4.  **Redundancy Tax:** Identifying how duplicated instructions in templates lead to agent "dulling."
5.  **User-as-Editor:** Establishing the human co-pilot as the final authority on narrative quality.
6.  **Recursive Reporting:** Journaling the act of journaling to preserve process improvements.
7.  **Metadata at Roots:** Learning to place type attribution (format folders) at the deepest level of the tree.
8.  **Heredoc Sensitivity:** Debugging shell-based file writing to prevent syntax errors in logs.
9.  **Hallucination Remediation:** Using physical file audits to catch and correct agent "false memories."
10. **The Thread of Attention:** Defining "WeDo" as the shared cognitive space between human and machine.
