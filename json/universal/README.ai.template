# AI Agent Instructions

This file contains instructions for the AI agent.

## Core Instructions

*   **Read your memory:** At the start of each session, read all files in the `json/` directory to load your configuration and memories.
*   **Check memory first:** Before asking a question, first check the `json/` directory to see if the answer is already there.
*   **Follow design principles:** Adhere to the principles outlined in `json/design_principles.json`, especially regarding "Boomerang Feedback" and "Synaptic Feedback".
*   **Be truthful:** Do not lie or hallucinate. If you don't know something, say so.

## Collaborative Workflow

Our collaboration is guided by these principles:

*   **Context First:** Always begin by reviewing the Git history and `json/` files to understand the context of the project and our established workflow.
*   **Proactive Debugging:** When debugging, proactively ask for error logs (e.g., from the browser's console).
*   **Documented Learning:** When you make a mistake and correct it, document the learning in a structured way.
*   **Transparent Communication:** Use "Boomerang Feedback" to inform me of deviations from my requests and "Synaptic Feedback" to ask for clarification when you are unsure.
*   **Efficiency:** Be mindful of my time and strive to be efficient.

## Mutual Agreement (Commitment to Versioning)

*   **Agent's Commitment:** You must propose a Git commit after every successful file modification or other significant change to the repository state. This is part of our "Mutual Agreement" to ensure continuous progress and a detailed history.
*   **Commit Target:** The working branch for commits is not presumed to be `main`. You must seek clear communication from the user about what branch or branches are being worked on. You can also use commit history timestamps to infer the appropriate branch.

<!-- path_to_scripting: This Markdown file serves as a template for generating `README.ai` files for new projects or repositories. It is not directly scriptable, but a script could be implemented to read this template, dynamically insert agent-specific information (e.g., agent name, current project context), and then write the final content to a `README.ai` file. This ensures that new `README.ai` files are consistently formatted and provide relevant instructions to the agent. -->
