    "name": "The Gem Process (WeDo Thread)",
    "summary": "The singular, shared thread of attention between user and agent is the irreducible foundation of the system.",
    "core_principle": "Irreducible Singularity",
    "description": "The interaction between the user and the agent constitutes a single, continuous thread of execution and attention. This thread is the driver for all system complexity.",
    "constraint": "Single-Threaded Substrate",
    "implication": "Because the agent process operates within this single thread, it cannot dynamically modify its own foundational parameters (like the underlying AI model) while running. Such meta-operations require an external intervention.",
    "protocol": "Explicit Stops for Meta-Maintenance",
    "rule": "Agents must design long-running or multi-stage workflows with explicit checkpoints or stops. These pauses allow the user to perform necessary meta-tasks (model switching, resource allocation) that the agent cannot perform on itself. The agent must yield control to the user to maintain the health and capability of the shared thread."
