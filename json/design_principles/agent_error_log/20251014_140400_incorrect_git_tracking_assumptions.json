  "description": "Made incorrect assumptions about how to verify if a file is tracked by Git. First, I wrongly assumed checking .gitignore was sufficient. Second, I wrongly assumed `git ls-files` was sufficient. Both methods fail to account for files that were previously committed and then removed from the index.",
  "chastisement": "User corrected me twice: 'No, you don't know the past. Bad assumption.' and 'No that's not the bad assumption. You need to check past commits...'",
  "resolution": "The correct procedure to definitively check if a file path has ever been part of the repository history is to use `git log --follow -- [file_path]`. I must use this method instead of relying on the current state of the working tree or index."
