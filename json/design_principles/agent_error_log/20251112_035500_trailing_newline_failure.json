  "description": "Failed to add a trailing newline to a file using the 'replace' and 'write_file' tools. The tools did not register a change when the only difference was a trailing newline. This appears to be an edge case with the tools.",
  "chastisement": "User pointed out the failure: 'The method you're using probably doesn't work because you're just added a trailing line. A bit of an edge case, literally, the trailing line.'",
  "resolution": "Used the shell command 'echo "" >> <file_path>' to successfully append a newline to the file. This method should be preferred for adding trailing newlines."
