  "path_to_scripting": "These are high-level design principles that are not directly scriptable. They guide the architecture of the agent's scripting system. For example, the 'Modularity' principle is implemented by having a library of small, single-purpose scripts. The 'Pipe within an AI Agent Process' principle is implemented by the agent's ability to chain commands together, passing the output of one command as the input to the next. The 'Simplicity over Easiness' principle is a meta-principle that guides the agent's LLM in generating simple and maintainable scripts."
