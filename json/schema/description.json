  "description": "This file defines the standard schema for all .memory/ JSON files. The core principle is the use of an array of objects for all collections of items, where each object has a 'name' or 'id' to uniquely identify it.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This JSON file provides a high-level description of the purpose of the schema definitions. It is not directly scriptable, but serves as documentation that an LLM can use to explain the importance of structured data and the conventions for defining schemas in the agent's memory. This helps to ensure consistency and maintainability of the agent's knowledge base."
