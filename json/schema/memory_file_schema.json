  "path_to_scripting": "This JSON file defines the schema for memory files. It is not directly scriptable, but its content is used by validation scripts. A script could be implemented to: 1) Read this schema file. 2) Iterate through all JSON files in the agent's memory (`.memory/` and `repos/diy-make/memory/public/json/`). 3) Validate each memory file against this schema. This ensures that the agent's memory files adhere to a consistent structure, preventing parsing errors and promoting data integrity."
