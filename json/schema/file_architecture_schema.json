      "name": "Filetype Attribution with Filesystem Von Neumann Architecture",
      "rule": "All files must reside in folders explicitly designated for their file type. No file should be stored in a generic or unrelated folder.",

      "name": "Sequential Indexing within File Type",
      "rule": "Files are indexed sequentially based on processing order within their file_type. The index is continuous across subdirectories.",
