It is not directly scriptable, but its content is used by validation scripts (as described in `memory_file_schema.json`). Any script that generates or modifies JSON data conforming to this schema would be implicitly following this rule. This ensures that items requiring a unique identifier always have one, maintaining data integrity and consistency."
