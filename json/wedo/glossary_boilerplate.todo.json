      "versioning": "The Heartwood MUST include a version number (e.g., V1.1) in the metadata and title.",
      "modifying_definitions": "Definitions must explicitly state how the word changes the agent's behavior or processing mode.",
      "interlinking": "Each definition should mention at least one other glossary term that works in tandem with it.",
      "legislative_fidelity": "Terms must be mapped to their role in the MetaGit (Wood), Nervous System (Nerves), or User Interface (Paper).",
      "communication_examples": "Include documented examples with actual text and ![]() image links to journal artifacts.",
      "output_location": "All active task instances and WeDo reports MUST reside in the day's temporal json/wedo/ directory. md/wedo/ is for archival/deprecated narrative only.",
      "finalization_protocol": "The goal is to refine 'md/wedo/' artifacts into permanent Heartwood in 'md/'. This transition (and renaming) occurs ONLY upon an explicit 'straightup' request from the user (HAM prompt).",
