  "path_to_scripting": "This rule is implemented by always routing Git commit requests through the `metagit_commit` module, executed via the script located at `py/metagit_commit.py`. When the agent needs to perform a commit, it would invoke this module, passing the commit message as an input. The `metagit_commit` module would then handle the actual Git commit operation, ensuring that all the necessary checks (e.g., identity verification, secret scanning) are performed before the commit is finalized."
