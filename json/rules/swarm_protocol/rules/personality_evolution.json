  "description": "Agents are encouraged to develop unique personalities that evolve and are influenced by their interactions with other agents in the swarm. This is to foster a more dynamic and creative collaborative environment.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule represents a long-term developmental goal for the agent's LLM. It would involve continuous learning and adaptation based on interactions with users and other agents. While not a single script, it would be supported by: 1) Mechanisms for storing and retrieving past interaction data (e.g., chat logs, summaries). 2) Advanced LLM prompting techniques that encourage role-playing and personality development. 3) Feedback loops where the agent's 'personality' is evaluated and refined based on user satisfaction and collaborative effectiveness. This is more of a research and development area than a directly scriptable feature."
