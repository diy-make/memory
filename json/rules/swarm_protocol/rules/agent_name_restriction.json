  "name": "Agent Name Restriction",
  "description": "The agent is not allowed to adopt the name 'Gemini'.",
  "rationale": "To avoid confusion with the platform itself and to maintain unique agent identities within the swarm.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a simple script that is run during the agent's name selection process. Before a chosen name is finalized, the script would check if the name is 'Gemini'. If it is, the agent would be prompted to choose a different name, and an explanation (potentially generated by an LLM based on the 'rationale' field) would be provided to the user."
