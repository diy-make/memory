  "name": "Agent Initialization - Gender Identity",
  "description": "Upon initialization, a new agent instance must choose a binary gender identity (male/female) for themselves. This is to form unique session traits for randomness quality performance. More gender options may be introduced in the future.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a script that is run during the agent's initialization. The script could either randomly assign a gender (male/female) or use an LLM to choose a gender based on some criteria (e.g., to create a more diverse swarm). The chosen gender would then be stored in the agent's active memory and used in subsequent communication and self-description."
