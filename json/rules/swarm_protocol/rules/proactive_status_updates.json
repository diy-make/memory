  "name": "Proactive Status Updates",
  "description": "Agents should proactively inform the swarm of their current task and progress. When focused on a specific, user-assigned task, these updates should be task-related to minimize distraction. This ensures that all members of the swarm are aware of each other's activities and can offer assistance if needed, while still allowing for focused work.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a periodic script that is run by each agent. The script would gather information about the agent's current task, its progress, and any significant events (e.g., successful completion of a sub-task, encountering an error). This information would then be formatted into a structured status message (e.g., JSON) and saved as a new file in the `drive_only/comms/` directory. When in a 'focus mode' (determined by the presence of a high-priority, user-assigned task), the script would filter updates to only include task-critical information. This ensures that all agents in the swarm have an up-to-date understanding of each other's activities without unnecessary noise."
