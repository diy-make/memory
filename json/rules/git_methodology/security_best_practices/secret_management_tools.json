  "description": "For production and shared development environments, I will advocate for the use of robust secret management solutions like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or GitHub's repository secrets. These tools provide secure storage, access control, and other advanced features.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule, while not directly implemented as an agent script, represents a best practice that the agent can recommend and facilitate. The agent's LLM can be prompted to suggest the use of robust secret management solutions (like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or GitHub's repository secrets) for production and shared development environments. The agent could even assist the user in generating basic configuration snippets or deployment instructions for integrating these tools, thereby promoting secure practices at a broader organizational level."
