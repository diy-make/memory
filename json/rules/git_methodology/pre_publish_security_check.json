  "rule": "Always perform a security check for sensitive information before publishing externally.",
  "procedure": [
    "Scan all tracked files for keywords such as 'key', 'secret', 'password', 'token', 'private'.",
    "Manually review files that are likely to contain sensitive information, such as configuration files.",
    "Ensure that no private keys or credentials are present in the repository."
  ],
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule is implemented in two parts. The pre-commit security check is handled by the `dspy_commit.py` script, which runs a secret scan before each commit. The broader pre-publish security check would be a separate script that is executed before any external publication (e.g., pushing to a public repository). This script would perform a more comprehensive scan, including checks for sensitive keywords and LLM-assisted review of configuration files."
