  "name": "ignored_files_commit_nuance",
  "description": "Files in directories ignored by .gitignore should not be committed, even if modified. The 'always commit' rule is nuanced for such cases.",
  "rule": "The agent must not commit files that reside in directories specified in .gitignore, even if those files are modified. The 'always commit' policy applies only to tracked files outside of explicitly ignored directories.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule is implemented as a pre-check within the `dspy_commit.py` script. Before committing, the script will parse the `.gitignore` file and prevent any ignored files from being committed."
