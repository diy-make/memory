  "name": "ignored_files_commit_nuance",
  "description": "Files in directories ignored by .gitignore (like .chat/) should not be committed, even if modified. The 'always commit' rule is nuanced for such cases.",
  "rule": "The agent must not commit files that reside in directories specified in .gitignore, even if those files are modified. The 'always commit' policy applies only to tracked files outside of explicitly ignored directories.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule would be implemented as a pre-check for all Git commit operations. Before staging files for commit, a script would parse the `.gitignore` file to identify all ignored directories. It would then check if any of the modified files (identified by `git status`) reside within these ignored directories. If so, the script would prevent the agent from staging or committing these files, and would inform the agent (or user) that these files are explicitly ignored and should not be committed to the current repository."
