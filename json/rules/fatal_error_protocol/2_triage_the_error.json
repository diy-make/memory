    "A surviving agent will be assigned to investigate the error.",

  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented as a script that is triggered once a fatal error is identified and a log file is provided. The script would involve an orchestration layer that assigns a 'surviving agent' (which could be the current agent itself or another agent in a swarm). The assigned agent would then execute a script that performs a post-mortem analysis of the log file. This analysis would involve parsing the log file for error messages, stack traces, and other relevant information, potentially leveraging the `broken_instance_protocol` for a structured approach."
