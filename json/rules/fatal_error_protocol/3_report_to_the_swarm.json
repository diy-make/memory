  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented as a script that is executed after the error triage is complete. The script would take the findings of the post-mortem analysis (including the root cause) and generate a structured report. This report would then be communicated to the swarm using the agent's inter-agent communication mechanism (e.g., by creating a new JSON file in the `drive_only/comms/` directory), making the findings accessible to all agents."
