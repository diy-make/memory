  "description": "Identify the last job the agent was working on before it terminated.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented as a script that feeds relevant portions of the analyzed log (from `4_analyze_extended_log.json`) to the agent's LLM. The LLM would be prompted to identify the last task or objective the agent was actively pursuing before its termination. This involves looking for explicit task assignments, command executions, or progress indicators within the log. The identified last job would be a key piece of information for any subsequent recovery or job takeover process."
