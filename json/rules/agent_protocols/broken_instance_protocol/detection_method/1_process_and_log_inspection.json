  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a script that is executed to identify active Gemini sessions and check their health. The script would execute `ps aux | grep script` to get a list of active `script` processes. It would then parse the output to extract the chat log file paths. For each chat log, it would use `tail` to inspect the end of the file for error messages or signs of malfunction. The script could then present a report to the agent's LLM, flagging any potentially broken instances."
