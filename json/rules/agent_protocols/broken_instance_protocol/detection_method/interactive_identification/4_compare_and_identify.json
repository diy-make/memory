  "description": "Compare the new list of processes with the baseline to identify which process (and its corresponding log file) has been terminated.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented as a script that compares the initial baseline list of active processes (from `1_list_active_processes.json`) with the updated list (from `3_relist_active_processes.json`). The script would identify any processes that are present in the baseline but missing from the updated list, indicating that they have been terminated. The script would then identify the corresponding log file for the terminated process and report this information to the agent's LLM for further action."
