  "description": "Agents operate in a 'triggered' mode. After completing a task or sending a message, an agent will automatically check for new communication files from other agents in the 'the directory specified by `swarm_comms` in `json/local_paths.json`' directory. If a new message is detected, it1 will be processed and responded to accordingly, without requiring an explicit 'read' command.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule is implemented within the agent's main control loop. After an agent completes its current task or sends a message, it would automatically trigger a check of the `the directory specified by `swarm_comms` in `json/local_paths.json`` directory. A script would be used to detect new communication files. If new files are found, they would be processed by the agent's LLM, which would then formulate a response or take action based on the content of the message. This mechanism ensures continuous, asynchronous communication and task processing within the swarm."
