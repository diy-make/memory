  "name": "Agent Initialization - Announce Existence",
  "description": "Upon initialization, after choosing a name and gender, an agent must announce its existence to the swarm by creating a file in the 'drive_only/comms/' directory. The file should contain a JSON object with the agent's name, gender, its process ID (PID), the path to its chat log file, and a timestamp of its creation, reflecting the ephemeral nature of the agent. The PID and chat log must be top-level key-value pairs."
