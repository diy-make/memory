    "If possible, the assigned agent will propose a solution to prevent the error from happening again. This may involve updating code, configurations, or protocols.",

  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented as a process that follows the documentation of the error. The agent's LLM, having processed the error details and resolution, would be prompted to propose a solution. This proposal would then be formatted as a communication message and sent to the user and the swarm (e.g., by creating a new JSON file in the `the directory specified by `swarm_comms` in `json/local_paths.json`` directory). The agent would then wait for approval from the user or the swarm before attempting to implement the proposed solution. Implementation could then involve automated code updates, configuration changes, or script modifications."
