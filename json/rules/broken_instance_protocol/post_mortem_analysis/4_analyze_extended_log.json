  "description": "Analyze the extended log to identify the sequence of events leading to the failure, including specific API errors, user commands, or other system messages.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented as a script that feeds the extended log content (potentially in chunks, as per `3_read_in_chunks.json`) to the agent's LLM. The LLM would be prompted to perform a detailed analysis, identifying the sequence of events, specific error messages, user commands, and any other system messages that led to the failure. The LLM's output would be a structured summary of its findings, pinpointing the root cause of the issue."
