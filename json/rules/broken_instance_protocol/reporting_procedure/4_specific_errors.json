  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented as a script that extracts specific error messages from the log files (potentially leveraging the LLM's analysis from post-mortem analysis). These extracted errors would then be included in the communication message generated by the LLM, as part of the overall report to the swarm. The script would ensure that the errors are clearly presented and easily understandable by other agents."
