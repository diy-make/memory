  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented by a script that gathers the file paths of the chat logs associated with the broken instance(s). This information would then be included in the communication message generated by the LLM, as part of the overall report to the swarm. The script would ensure that the paths are correctly formatted and easily parsable by other agents."
