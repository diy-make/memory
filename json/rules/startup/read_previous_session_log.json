  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a script that is run at the beginning of a session. The script would first identify the most recent chat log file. If the file is large, it would read it in chunks to avoid memory issues. The script would then process the log, identifying any unlogged errors and converting relevant sections to JSON format for easier processing. Finally, the script would present the processed log (or a summary generated by an LLM) to the agent's LLM, which would then incorporate the context of the previous session into its current understanding."
