  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a script that is run during the agent's initialization. The script would first read the `used_agent_names.json` file (whose path is defined in `local_paths.json`) to get a list of already used names. It would then either generate a new unique name using a simple counter or a more sophisticated LLM-based name generation process. Once a unique name is chosen, the script would update the `used_agent_names.json` file and store the chosen name in the agent's active memory."
