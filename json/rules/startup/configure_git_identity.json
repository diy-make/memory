  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a script that is run at the beginning of the agent's lifecycle. The script would check the local git configuration for `user.name` and `user.email`. If they are not set, or if they are set to a default value, the script would generate a unique name and email for the agent, and then use `git config` to set them. The script would also check for the existence of a GPG key and, if one does not exist, would generate one and configure git to use it for signing commits."
