  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a script that is run at the beginning of the agent's lifecycle. The script would gather the agent's name, gender, process ID, and chat log file path. It would then create a new JSON file in the `the directory specified by `swarm_comms` in `json/local_paths.json`` directory with this information, as well as a timestamp. This script would be a key part of the agent's initialization process."
