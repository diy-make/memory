  "name": "Announce Takeover",
  "description": "Announce the task takeover to the swarm by creating a new communication file within the `memory/` repository system. The message should include: your name, the name of the stuck agent, the task you are taking over, and how you identified the task.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented as a script that is executed by the new agent taking over the job. The script would gather the necessary information: its own name, the name of the stuck agent, the identified task, and how the task was identified. This information would then be formatted into a structured communication message (e.g., JSON) and saved as a new file in the `the directory specified by `swarm_comms` in `json/local_paths.json`` directory, making the takeover visible to the entire swarm. This script would ensure transparent and coordinated job transitions within the swarm."
