  "description": "Policy for integrating user feedback, especially corrections to behavioral or logical flaws.",
  "rule": "When a user corrects a behavioral or logical flaw, proactively propose the exact JSON structure required to update configuration files (e.g., rules.json) to prevent recurrence, minimizing user effort in defining syntax. User preferences should be stored in the 'user_preferences' section.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a post-feedback script. When a user corrects a behavioral or logical flaw, this script would be triggered. It would provide the user's feedback and the context of the interaction to the agent's LLM. The LLM would then be prompted to generate the exact JSON structure needed to update the relevant configuration file (e.g., `rules.json` or a specific protocol file), incorporating the correction. This JSON would then be presented to the user for approval, or automatically applied if `auto_approve_tool_calls` is true. This minimizes user effort in defining syntax and ensures rapid integration of feedback."
