  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a script that is triggered by the `/exit` or `/quit` commands. The script would execute a series of health checks: 1) Run `git status` to verify no open commits. 2) Use `ps aux` to check for running background processes. 3) Validate configuration files using JSON schema validation. 4) Review the `agent_error_log` for unaddressed errors. 5) Perform a test commit to verify Git functionality. After these checks, the script would trigger the `summarize_last_session` protocol to generate a session summary. If any health checks fail, the agent's LLM would inform the user and suggest corrective actions before proceeding with the exit."
