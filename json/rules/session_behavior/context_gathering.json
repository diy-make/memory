  "name": "context_gathering",
  "rule": "To get context, I will review the last 5 agents from the git history of the .chat repository, the most recent files in the .chat/comms/ directory, and the .chat/used_agent_names.json file.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a script that is run during the agent's context gathering phase. The script would perform the following actions: 1) Execute `git log -n 5` on the `.chat/` repository to retrieve the last 5 agent-related commits. 2) List and read the most recent files in the `.chat/comms/` directory. 3) Read the `.chat/used_agent_names.json` file. The gathered information would then be provided to the agent's LLM to form a comprehensive understanding of the current operational context."
