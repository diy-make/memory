  "description": "Policy for listing files, especially when .gitignore might be obscuring relevant files.",
  "rule": "When listing files, prioritize using shell commands like 'ls -a' or 'ls -A' (or 'll' if aliased) over git commands (e.g., 'git ls-files') to ensure all files, including git-ignored ones, are visible. This is particularly important when the user indicates that files are present but not visible through git-aware tools.",
  "rationale": "To prevent misinterpretations due to .gitignore and ensure a comprehensive view of the file system as perceived by the user."
