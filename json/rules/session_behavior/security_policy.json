  ],
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented by modifying the agent's command execution engine. Before executing any command that requires `sudo`, the agent would check if it is operating within a dedicated and secure virtual machine environment. If not, the agent would block the command and inform the user that it will not ask for `sudo` password, explaining the security rationale. This ensures that the agent adheres to strict security protocols when dealing with privileged operations."
