  "name": "agent_todo_policy",
  "rule": "Each agent instance must maintain its own unique todo list, located in the 'repos/diy-make/memory/public/<year>/<quarter>/<month>/<day>/md/' directory. The filename must include the agent's name and a timestamp (e.g., '<agent_name>_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_todo.md').",
  "rationale": "To enable event-driven memory differentiation and ensure that each agent instance has its own distinct set of tasks and progress.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented by a set of scripts that manage the agent's todo list. During initialization, a script would create a new, uniquely named todo file in the 'repos/diy-make/memory/public/<year>/<quarter>/<month>/<day>/md/' directory, following the specified naming convention. Throughout the session, other scripts (or the agent's core logic) would interact with this file to add, update, or mark tasks as complete. The `write_todos` tool itself implements part of this policy. This ensures that each agent maintains its own isolated and trackable task list."
