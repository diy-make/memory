  "rule": "If a code modification results in a reduction of logic or lines of code by more than 20%, provide a brief explanation for the reduction.",
  "threshold": 0.2,
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a post-modification script. After the agent makes a code modification, this script would analyze the diff to calculate the percentage reduction in lines of code or logic. If the reduction exceeds the `threshold` (0.2 or 20%), the script would prompt the agent's LLM to generate a brief explanation for the reduction. This explanation would then be included in the commit message or as an inline comment in the code, providing valuable context for the change."
