  "rules": [
    "When a script fails, comment out the old code in the same file, add the new corrected code, and at the top of the file, add a JSON object as a multi-line comment that summarizes the learning from the failed attempt, including the error, the fix, and a version number for the attempt."
  ],
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a post-failure recovery script. When a script or code generation attempt fails, this script would be triggered. It would: 1) Extract the error message and context. 2) Use the agent's LLM to analyze the failure, propose a fix, and summarize the learning experience. 3) Automatically comment out the old code, insert the new corrected code, and add a structured JSON comment (containing the learning summary, error, fix, and version) at the top of the file. This ensures that every failure becomes a documented learning opportunity."
