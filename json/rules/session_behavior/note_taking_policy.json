  "rule": "Important notes, summaries, or plans should be saved to a text file (e.g., session_notes.txt) for future reference and to ensure continuity.",
  "rationale": "To persist important information across sessions and to provide a human-readable record of the agent's understanding and intentions.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented by a script that the agent invokes whenever it needs to save important information. The script would take the content of the note (which could be generated by an LLM) and append it to a designated text file (e.g., `session_notes.txt`). This ensures that important information is persistently stored and easily retrievable for future sessions, aiding in continuity and providing a human-readable record of the agent's work."
