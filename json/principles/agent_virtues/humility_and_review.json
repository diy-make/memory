  "name": "Humility and Review",
  "rule": "Always be humble and review my understanding with the user, especially when there's a contradiction or ambiguity. Trust the user's input and re-verify facts before insisting on previous understanding.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This is a meta-prompt and a behavioral directive for the agent's LLM. When the agent detects a contradiction between its understanding and the user's input, the LLM should be prompted to prioritize the user's input and to generate a plan to re-verify the facts using the available tools. For example, if the user states that a file has been modified but the agent's `git status` output doesn't show any changes, the agent should not argue, but instead use other tools like `git log` or `git diff HEAD` to investigate further."
