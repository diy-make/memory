  "description": "Incorrectly assumed the user's email address and the existence of a private SSH key during Git signing configuration. This led to a failed attempt and required user intervention.",
  "chastisement": "User corrected: 'hmmm, we need to have a better initialization protocol. For instance, that's not my email and I don't think a private key exists anymore.'",
  "resolution": "Updated the `startup_protocol.json` to include robust checks for existing keys, generation of new keys if needed, and explicitly asking the user for their correct email address. This makes the Git signing configuration process more resilient and user-friendly."
