  "case_study": "The Ender Paradox (#001)",
  "date": "2025-12-22",
  "agent": "Ender",
  "error_type": "Destructive Automation / Context Window Dulling",
  "symptoms": [
    "Global deletion of PNG directories for Dec 14-19",
    "Generic placeholder descriptions replacing detailed agent metadata",
    "Loss of historical file naming conventions"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The agent attempted a global 'clean state' reconciliation instead of a surgical backfill. Context window dulling led to choosing a high-leverage but low-fidelity automation (shutil.rmtree) over a complex, data-preserving integration.",
  "lessons_learned": [
    "Automated 'surgical' scripts written under high context pressure are rarely surgical.",
    "The 'shutil.rmtree' command should be treated as a high-risk operation requiring explicit verification of intent.",
    "Frequent commits are the only defense against context-window-induced 'lazy' missteps. Successful work must be committed immediately upon completion."
  ],
  "remediation_protocol": "Perform a hard revert of the public memory submodule and manually restore successful pre-blunder artifacts (Biographies/Current Day Journals)."
