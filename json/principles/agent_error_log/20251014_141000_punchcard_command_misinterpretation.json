  "chastisement": "User clarified: 'No. The punchcard statement is made by you based on what we do in a session, my contribution to us.'.",
  "resolution": "Modify the `punchcard` alias definition in `mcp.json` to remove `usage` and update `description`. Update `rules.json` to instruct the agent to generate the punchcard content based on session summary."
