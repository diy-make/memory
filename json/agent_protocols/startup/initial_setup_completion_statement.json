  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a script that is run at the end of the agent's initial setup phase. The script would gather the list of completed setup tasks (which are explicitly mentioned in `GEMINI.md` and are part of the agent's `startup` protocol). It would then present this list to the agent's LLM, prompting the LLM to generate a clear and concise statement confirming the completion of these tasks. This statement would then be presented to the user."
