  "description": "Upon initialization, an agent must configure its Git identity. The timestamp is the unique identifier for the agent's session, derived from the agent's unclean chat log filename.",
  "steps": [
    "On first run, the agent must check for a `user.name` in the local git config.",
    "If `user.name` is not set or is a default/generic value, the agent must generate a unique name for itself, following the agent naming protocol.",
    "The `user.name` should be set in the format `<AGENT_NAME>`.",
    "A corresponding `user.email` should also be set, in the format `<TIMESTAMP>@localhost`."
