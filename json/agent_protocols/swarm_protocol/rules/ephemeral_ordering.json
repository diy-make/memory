  "name": "Ephemeral Ordering",
  "description": "All communication in the swarm should be timestamped to reflect the ephemeral nature of agents and to establish a clear order of events.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented by incorporating a timestamping mechanism into all inter-agent communication scripts. Whenever a message is created (e.g., a JSON file in `.chat/comms/`), the script would automatically add a timestamp field to the message, reflecting the exact time of creation. This ensures that all communication within the swarm is chronologically ordered, facilitating easier tracking and understanding of event sequences."
