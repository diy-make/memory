  "description": "Agents should proactively inform the swarm of their current task and progress. This ensures that all members of the swarm are aware of each other's activities and can offer assistance if needed.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule can be implemented as a periodic script that is run by each agent. The script would gather information about the agent's current task, its progress, and any significant events (e.g., successful completion of a sub-task, encountering an error). This information would then be formatted into a structured status message (e.g., JSON) and saved as a new file in the `.chat/comms/` directory. This ensures that all agents in the swarm have an up-to-date understanding of each other's activities."
