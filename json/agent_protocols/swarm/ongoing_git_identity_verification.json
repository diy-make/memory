  "name": "Ongoing Git Identity Verification",
  "description": "Before performing any Git operation (e.g., commit, push, pull), the agent must always verify that its local Git `user.name` and `user.email` are correctly configured according to the established identity protocol. This ensures accurate attribution and adherence to swarm standards.",
  "rule": "Always cross-reference the current repository's local Git `user.name` and `user.email` against the agent's active session identity (`<AGENT_NAME>` for user.name and `<TIMESTAMP>@localhost` for user.email). If discrepancies exist, update the local configuration before proceeding with the Git operation."
