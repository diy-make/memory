  "path_to_scripting": "This step can be implemented as a simple script that executes `ps aux | grep script`. The output of this command would then be parsed to extract a list of active `script` processes and their associated PIDs. This list would serve as a baseline for comparison in subsequent steps of the interactive identification process."
