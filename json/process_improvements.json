      "problem": "Incorrectly assumed the user's email address and the existence of a private SSH key.",
      "solution": "Updated the `startup_protocol.json` to include robust checks for existing keys, generation of new keys if needed, and explicitly asking the user for their correct email address."

      "problem": "Failed to set the GNU Screen tab name during startup, despite the instruction being present in `GEMINI.md`, `rules.json`, and `startup_protocol.json`.",
      "solution": "Explicitly executed the `screen -X title \"<agent_name>\"` command to set the tab name."

      "area": "Markdown File Interaction",
      "problem": "Repeatedly failed to directly output markdown file content in chat, instead using tool calls (read_file, cat) which didn't display the content to the user for discussion.",
      "solution": "When interacting with markdown (.md) files for review or discussion, the agent must output the content directly as part of its normal response, without using shell commands or `read_file` tool calls. This ensures the user can see and work on the content immediately."
