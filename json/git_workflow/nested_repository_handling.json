  "name": "Nested Repository Handling",
  "description": "This repository acts as a 'meta-repo' and contains other, separate Git repositories within its directory structure. These nested repositories are ignored by this parent repository's .gitignore file.",
  "rule": "The agent must not attempt to stage or commit changes to files within these nested repositories from the parent repository. All Git operations for a nested repository must be performed from within that nested repository's own directory."
