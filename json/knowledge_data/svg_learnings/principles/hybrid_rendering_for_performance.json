  "name": "Hybrid Rendering for Performance",
  "summary": "For complex drawings with a high density of repeating elements, a hybrid rendering strategy is essential to balance file size, performance, and visual detail.",
  "strategy": {
    "description": "For each layer, calculate a complexity metric. If the metric exceeds a defined threshold, render that layer and all subsequent outer layers using an efficient pattern-based overlay. Render layers below the threshold using individual, detailed elements.",
    "metrics": {
      "tile_count": "The total number of individual tiles within a layer's area. Simple to calculate, but can grow extremely fast.",
      "boundary_size": "The perimeter of a layer's bounding box (e.g., 2 * (width + height)). This can be a more stable indicator of the complexity of the layer's edge."
