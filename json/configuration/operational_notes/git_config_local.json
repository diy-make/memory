  "path_to_scripting": "This rule informs the `configure_git_identity` script (located in `agent_protocols/startup/configure_git_identity.json`). The script, when setting up the agent's Git identity, must ensure that `user.name` and `user.email` are configured locally for the specific repository (using `git config --local`). It must also adhere to the specified format for `user.name` (agent's name) and `user.email` (`<agent_name>@localhost`). This ensures that the agent's Git identity is correctly isolated and attributed."
