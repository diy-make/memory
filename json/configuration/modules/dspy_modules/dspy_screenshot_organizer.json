  "module_name": "dspy_screenshot_organizer",
  "script_path": "py/dspy_screenshot_organizer.py",
  "purpose": "Organizes new screenshots by renaming them with descriptive names, moving them to the appropriate daily `png/` folder, and creating index and `Screenshots.md` files within the `memory/public/` repository.",
  "dependencies": [],
  "inputs": {
    "source_png_dir": "string (The path to the directory containing new screenshots.)"
  },
  "outputs": {
    "status": "string (A summary of the organization process, including which files were moved and what index files were created.)"
  },
  "path_to_scripting": "This module is a self-contained Python script. It would be invoked periodically or on demand. The script would scan a specified `source_png_dir` for new screenshots. For each screenshot, it would rename it descriptively (potentially using an LLM to generate the name), move it to a date-stamped `png/` folder, and update relevant index files (like `Screenshots.md`). The output would be a status message detailing the organization process."
