  "description": "Generates a new JSON punchcard file in the .work/ directory summarizing the session's activities and your contributions.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This alias invokes an internal agent action, `create_json_punchcard`. This action would be implemented as a script or a function within the agent's core logic. It would be responsible for gathering relevant session activities and contributions, formatting them into a JSON punchcard file, and then saving this file to the specified `target_directory`. This is a script that orchestrates data gathering and file writing, potentially involving LLM summarization of session activities."
