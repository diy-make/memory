  "name": "Commit Signing Configuration",
  "description": "To ensure the integrity of commits made by the agent while not interfering with the user's global Git configuration, the following setup is used:",
  "steps": [
    "Global commit signing is explicitly disabled (`git config --global commit.gpgsign false`) to avoid affecting the user's other repositories.",
    "Repository-level commit signing is enabled for this specific repository (`git config commit.gpgsign true`), ensuring all commits made by the agent are signed.",
    "The signing key is a dedicated SSH key located at `.gemini/.ssh/user_key`.",
    "The Git GPG format is set to 'ssh' (`git config --global gpg.format ssh`).",
    "An `allowed_signers` file at `.gemini/.ssh/allowed_signers` is used to verify the key, linking the user's email to the public key."
  ],
  "outcome": "All commits made by the agent within this repository will be automatically signed with the designated SSH key. The user's commits outside of this session or in other repositories remain unaffected."
