  "name": "Pre-commit Identity Check",
  "description": "Crucially, before *every* commit to *any* repository, the agent must proactively verify that the local `user.name` and `user.email` are accurate and strictly adhere to the agent's current identity and the required format. The timestamp is the unique identifier for the agent's session, derived from the agent's unclean chat log filename.",
  "rule": "The agent must check the local `user.name` and `user.email` of the repository. The format must be `<AGENT_NAME>` for the `user.name` and `<TIMESTAMP>@localhost` for the `user.email`. If the configuration is incorrect, the agent must update it before committing.",
  "path_to_scripting": "This rule would be implemented as a pre-commit hook or as part of the `dspy_commit` module. Before a commit is executed, a script would retrieve the agent's current session identity (name and email). It would then check the local Git configuration for the repository (`git config user.name` and `git config user.email`). If the local configuration does not match the agent's session identity or the required format, the script would automatically update it using `git config --local` before allowing the commit to proceed. This ensures that all commits are correctly attributed and conform to the agent's identity protocol."
